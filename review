He's a chihuahua mix, and as I was reading such mixed reviews about whether small dogs would benefit from a high protein diet or not I decided I just had to try it for myself. He did have a little trouble with digestion while I was transitioning him to the food, he was eating Royal Canin prior. He's been eating it for about seven months now and he's doing phenomenal. He has great muscle tone and energy. His coat is silky and shinny when it had been coarse and dull. Yes, it's on the pricey side but if you closely watch what you put in your body as humans why wouldn't you want your best friend to benefit from great food."

Cooley ""Let There Be Rock""",25,25,1,1292371200,"Don't Be Fooled By The Picture!!!","We purchased this ""Basket/Tower"" for our wonderful neighbors as a holiday gift.  The picture on Amazon makes it look like a fantastic value.  What appears to be an overflowing array of Kosher goods in reality is a 8 inch tall stack of 3 tiny boxes full of next to nothing! For $26 you are WASTING YOUR MONEY!  You could not go to a grocery store and put together something yourself that would be 3 times as large for the same money.<br /><br />I normally don't leave negative reviews, but for the first time in a long time, I feel taken.  NOT WORTH A DIME, more or less, $26 of your hard earned cash not."
