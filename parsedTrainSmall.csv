a3w2px96k1ba3m|you may laugh  but i have found that otherland volumes 1 4 are poor at picking up debris around the house   i once spilled some cornflakes on the floor  and foolishly thought that i could clean it up by dropping   34 city of golden shadows  34  on it   not only did it not clean  it managed to make things worse by fragmenting the cornflakes into smaller and smaller pieces   i did what any normal person would do  i stacked the other books on top  hoping that the combined power would whisk the cornflakes away to the technological wonderland that is otherland   no such results bin otherland empty  on the other hand  works like magic   if you hook it up to a powerful enough motor  you can banish those cornflakes to the land of wind and ghosts   the downside is that it s pretty light reading  but given the young adult trend these days it s following the light reading trend that literature is headed for these days it s recommended that you get through the previous volume though    34 hoover electrical vaccum unit  34     i mean  bin otherland empty does work as a stand alone  but it s not quite as absorbing when not paired up with the prequel   some people think you can skip the previous volume and lust stick your mouth in at one end and suck  but  c mon  that s just gross spoiler alert   cornflakes vaccumed up |5.0

a3mw7jnpgikp5c|i got this in pink and white for a slender 2 year old  it is a little on the loose side  but it does stay on  while my little girl is a bit of a tomboy  as she is overshadowed by 5 older brothers  she does enjoy wearing this over her jeggings and running around and playing  her playdates  two who are closer to 3  are madly in love with the tutus  it s a good thing we only have one of them at a time  i think that it would ideally fit a 3 or 4 year old without any stretch  but could fit kids possibly up to the age of twelve with the amount of stretch it has  the elastic has very nice give and the layers of tulle are very nicely proportioned and soft  after throwing it in the wash  the edges can curl a little with minimal fray  maybe i could have put it on a gentler cycle  but it looks pretty much lithe same  i really like the way the elastic is sewn in  the satin edge is part of the tulle fabric  not sewn on  and the elastic is enclosed between the layers of the satin edge  making it seem pretty secure  i have made my own tutus  but they never looked as nice or were so soft |5.0

a1kp12ivp6lagl|doublespeak is truly a language unto itself   a fair comparison would be the similarities between british english and american english   both use the same words which would lead some people to think they were the same language   that is until one hears that drivers in england keep their jacks in the boot  and take a lift up to their flat so does doublespeak use words from english but with a distinct accent that tells you the speaker is not from around here some people may not like the tone of the book   however when you realize that the author also wrote the cambridge thesaurus of american english  you ll understand why after several decades studying deception in language he used such a sarcastic tone in presenting examples of such this book is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand how scam artists use innocent words for nefarious ends   perhaps people like bernie madoff would have been less successful in running their scams if more people were aware of and watchful for doublespeak |5.0
ag7r3mmf8qldt|double speak presents an interesting collection of countless issues of semantics  some comical  some downright shocking when words are used with the intention of implying one meaning yet are open to completely different connotations  this usage can be exploited to convince  misrepresent  or simply to provide one a convenient means of retraction lutz provides examples of double speak in politics  business  world events  sports  law  and many others areas of interest   i found many of the revelations intriguing and entertaining and would recommend this book for light reading or for anyone researching deliberate misusage of the english language for benefit |4.0

ah3qc2pc1vtgp|i have to admit that i am a fan of giada s cooking and i had great expectations when i ordered this set  they were however  crushed  while i still love giada s cooking  this set is just a way for food network to make money  they really cheated with these dvd s  all they have are the video from the show  no text recipes  no link to the on line shows and no computer support  they play in windows media player but the set does not contain the recipes  you can get more by taping the shows and then going to the web to download recipes  another disappointment is the so so transfer quality to dvd  perhaps i ve been spoiled by hd and tivo but the older shows i ve recorded have had better playback quality than the episodes on the dvd s  it is in the old 480p but the quality of the transfer to dvd is dark and about the same quality as your average old vhs tape  not dvd quality  i get the impression food network got cheap and subbed out the dvd transfer to the lowest bidder  china   and it shows i could watch giada read the dictionary and her cooking is really first rate  but  that s all you get is watching giada  thank god she is easy to understand and her recipes are easy to follow  but to get consistent results on some of the dishes  you should search the web and find the hard copies   while giada herself is great  this set is a waste of money  you re better off recording the shows and going to the web to get the recipes you want or  better yet  just stick with her cookbooks which are all first rate and worlds above this cheap presentation |2.0

a3sd4wb85h41zx|unto full staturethis book will be a great blessing to anyone who sacrifically seeks to mature spiritually beyond the first step of being saved and becoming babes in the faith but growing to the fullness of discipleship and sonship under god on earth in accordance with the plan god had in his creation before time began   to get the greatest blessing  the book probably needs to be read  reread and meditated on and cotemplated a bit at a time over an extended period of time and exposure to the trials and experiences of life   involves being in full intimate fellowship with god  his son and god s holy spirit  allowing them to become indwelling within the reader and growing into union with the trinity   there might be greater value in using the book with one or more companions similarly seeking full spiritual stature |5.0

asb0e2o2flna7|book review  joe herzanek  why don t they just quit   addicts and alcoholic s aren t crazy and they can quit   joe herzanekas the single mother of a heroin addict  i believed addiction was a complex and confusing conundrum   being a control freak  i struggled to understand even the delicate changes occurring in my son   i spent hours  days  months researching addiction  recovery and relapse  hoping to find the magic cure   and then i was handed   why don t they just quit   the award winning self help book written by joe and judy herzanek joe writes a powerful and honest account of his own struggle with addiction and subsequent successful recovery  thirty years strong   he provides valuable and often misunderstood insights from the addict s point of view  offering amazingly simple reasons for why the addict does not quit  consequences became a reason for using  not a deterrent  joe explains as he explores reasons addicts just don t quit   drugs dull the senses  numb the pain and fade the situations  allowing the addict an escape from their problems   people use drugs to increase pleasure and decrease pain   writes  joe  families and friends always try to help the addict see the problem  it doesn t happen over night  they do not see the problem as it unfolds  this person typically is in denial  they will typically put this off rather than confront   joe herzanekdespite mounting pressures  whether financial  social  legal or emotional  the addict cannot see the problem for what it has become  rather the mounting pressures become the reason to continue using  in order to not deal with them  it seems so obvious when joe describes the stress and the inability to deal with it that creates the vicious cycle i helplessly watched my son spiral through joe recounts personal failures and near tragic family circumstances as a result of addictions  but also provides a road map of sorts to navigate through the cause and progression of addiction  the treatment options as well as common sense answers to not so simple questions in  why don t they just quit  joe aptly dispels the myth of hitting rock bottom  this whole idea of  hitting bottom  is out of date  some people with wait years even decades  for their friends to reach thus mythical point in their alcohol and drug use  but why wait for them to  hit bottom   why not help them by raising their bottom  there are ways to encourage someone to reach their bottom much earlier  in doing so  we can avoid a lot of unnecessary pain and heartache  and maybe even save their life  for some people  hitting bottom will be six feet underground   joe herzanekas i struggled to  tough love  it with my son  i never thought of it as raising his bottom  i only looked at as a way to preserve my sanity  and then only after i attempted to help my son  which really meant enabling the behavior to continue  so does everyone have to hit rock bottom  i would say no  tough love can prevent a substance abuser from prolonging their usage  there are loving ways to refuse to rescue someone that in the long run will help them to choose recovery  loving means doing the right thing to help   joe herzanekjoe leaves no stone unturned when it comes to addiction and its far reaching consequences  addiction affects the entire family  from spouses  to parents  to siblings full of useful quotes and quips from both famous and not so famous  as well as personal adages from his family and friends  joe herzanek takes a very messy  complex and taboo subject  and twists it into a story of hope  courage and healing  quitting is a moment in time  it is not recovery  joe warns the reader   he provides treatment options and despite being a chaplain  he tempers his own faith with the 12 step  higher power   the last thing i want to do in this section is to get too preachy  spiritual growth is very personal  what i am saying is that spirituality is a big part of recovery and is too important to ignore   joe herzaneki highly recommend this read to any person living with or loving an addict  a toolbox of helpful insights  answers to seemingly impossible questions  and road map through the struggles of addiction  this book is the ultimate idiots guide to addiction  recovery and relapse  and a must to all struggling in this realm |5.0

a2t8a34zsaxgha| why don t they just quit  could not hold my attention that i wouldn t even dare to bore my adult substance addiction therapy group with it  to show this to a population of substance abusers would put them to sleep  the kind of addiction films that stimulate my clients are the ones that explain how they got addicted  why they are addicted  and what can be done about it from a psychological  biological  and physiology perspective  psychological  biological  and physiological films make them feel as if they are a person first with some issues  instead of making them feel they are labeled as a problem with the identity of an alcoholic or addict  a person second  in which this dvd takes that position  good addiction films today move fast  scene to scene  with music in background and people talking scene to scene with speed  this dvd has the same two or four people sitting around a table talking about  the alcoholic or drug user  with the same monotone voices  the background is black and has a bowl of fruit to look at on the table but doesn t even have something to look at in the background such as cars going by in a window or pictures or a bookshelf  this dvd definitely isn t for substance user abuser audience or a therapist that already has knowledge about addictions  it is more suited for those that don t know anything about addictions and who doesn t have substance using issues  i would recommend this dvd for family members experiencing a love one with using issues or a student first learning about addictions for their studies in the mental health or medical field because the dvd pretty much covers all the basics a to z about understanding a person with alcohol or drug issues  i also recommend  to really get to know what a substance user is experiencing is to attend a few aa and or na speaker night meetings to hear how they journeyed through their recovery process |2.0

a1mostxnio5mpj|i first read the prophet in college back in the 60 s  the book had a revival as did anything metaphysical in the turbulent 60 s  it had a profound effect on me and became a book i always took with me  after graduation i joined the peace corps and during stressful training in country  liberia  at times of illness and the night before i left  this book gave me great comfort  i read it before i married  just before and again after my children were born and again after two near fatal illnesses  i am always amazed that there is a chapter that reaches out to you  grabs you and offers both comfort and hope for the future gibran offers timeless insights and love with each word  i think that we as a nation should read and learn the lessons here  it is definitely a time for thought and reflection this book could guide us through |5.0
a2xq5lzhtd4aft|a timeless classic   it is a very demanding and assuming title  but gibran backs it up with some excellent style and content   if he had the means to publish it a century or two earlier  he could have inspired a new religion from the mouth of an old man about to sail away to a far away destination  we hear the wisdom of life and all important aspects of it   it is a messege   a guide book   a sufi sermon  much is put in perspective without any hint of a dogma   there is much that hints at his birth place  lebanon where many of the old prophets walked the earth and where this book project first germinated most likely probably becuase it was written in english originally  the writing flows  it is pleasant to read  and the charcoal drawings of the author decorating the pages is a plus   i loved the cover |5.0

a1sgx7ztfnry59| the prophet  is a powerful book of topical wisdom by lebanese author and poet khalil ghibran  the book begins when a fictional prophet arrives mysteriously by ship and is taken in by a group of people who he remains among for several years  before he leaves  he wants to thank them for their kindness but has nothing to give  so he gathers the people together and answers their questions with his wisdom on various aspects of life  the premise is similar to that of the tao te ching and lao tzu imparting his wisdom to a guard  every chapter is beautifully written in simple yet profound prose  balance and the oneness of life are big themes  ghibran is so artful in his use of metaphors and doesn t waste a single word  if ever there were a great gift book  this is one  i think it s a classic that everyone should read once but most will find themselves returning to many times over the years |5.0

a19n3fcqcljyua|i discovered the prophet fifty years ago in college and have read it dozens of times since then   now  in addition to my beat up hard copy  i have a portable e copy   if you were looking for an example of an intelligently designed  pun intended  book of spiritual guidance  this would be it   it doesn t care how you picture  name or define   34 god  34  or whether you give him a gender and a personality   it just cuts to the heart of how to live and how to relate to others   if jesus and the buddha teamed up to write a book  it might come out like this when i first read it  i found some passages difficult to grasp   looking back  i now think that it was not because they were hard to understand  but because i did not want to hear gently spoken  intelligently phrased ideas that contradicted my own   now  if i could have only one book  this would probably be it |5.0

ak0fi0vikmxh9|i don t usually read for pleasure  in fact this book took me a month to finish because i read it so sporadically  but it was an easy read and a rather short book  very rich and quite honestly an example of getting more enlightenment from less text than most other books |5.0

a1tt4cy55wlhar|i have the 1972 version  bought in 1974  the 1972 version originally had a dust jacket but my dust jacket is long gone  this particular rendition has had many re printings  for a reason  it s very popular  the textured paper  old style typography  and leather cover are better than a plain old paperback  the size is diminutive  which is perfect for this book |5.0

a3nawi4l7zbpjo|since i absolutely loved this book while in high school  i gave copies to each of my daughters   the beauty of these written words is difficult to describe and a must read |4.0
a2x4he21jtal98|anything i ve read by gibran is  in my mind  flawless  this  the most famous of his works  is no exception  it is simple  yet deep  honest and profound  moving and inspirational  gibran s work is one of a kind  and can be far more encouraging and moving than any self help program or therapy or anything like that  the poetic style  the aphorisms  the parables  the almost biblical feel  are all just what over worked  over stressed  modern and spiritually starved worldly people need |5.0
ardq9knb8k22n|cool book  i really like the quality of the production   black clothbound with gold embossing and nice paper  looks to be cotton rag   i am proud to include it in my collection   intrigueing story full of the sort of passion that does not cloud the mind or divert truth but instead is revealing and living  very readable  the stories are short and highly economic so that one is likely to read for only a minute or two until something insightful is revealed  it is full of timeless truths which are of lasting value to the reader and inform life   the language and delivery is familiar yet of a quality that is penetrating in a similar way as it might be listening to a surmon by jesus   i give it 5 stars  i considered giving only 4 stars because the format is fairly predictable but i have decided that this quality is actually a strength as one can pick up the book at any point and continue until the end   and then start over for that matter   excellent for busy people or commuters |5.0
a27zh1aqorj1l|this book is everything that is simple  delicate  true  and beautiful i have read few books so touching and enlightening   quot the prophet quot  is a true masterpiece that has that feeling of ancient wisdom in it  the wisdom of the text is gentle  yet insistent  it lets you understand things you ve always known my feelings defy description |5.0
a5e9tsd20u9pr|for those who don t know gibran  get to know his work  the prophet is a must read  his outlook on life is truly an inspiring guide on how to approach major life decisions  this is a relationship with a man s work you won t regret having |5.0
a26gkzps079gff|i would have to say that this is the best book i ve ever read   i could feel every word deep in my heart everytime  of the many times i ve read it   i would never get enough of it  its a treasure  |5.0
a3uzside90jww1|i read this book at least once a year and every year i gain new insight from it  this book changed my life and i hope it does that same for you  if you re looking for something with poetic  beautifully grafted language than look no further  kahlil gibran talks about all aspects of life  marriage  love  religion  eating  etc  anything that is of relative importance he talks about  if you re not sure about it  go for it  it s a really short book and i assure you won t be disappointed |5.0
a34gjpysogmq35|despite the many redeeming aspects of this moral tale  there is just no denying that kahlil was a little simple   what many mistake as genius  underneath is nothing but undeniable cold hard facts about ethics   anyone from the womb can fathom the ideas discussed in this book   there is no reason to shroud it in a fable of unusual circumstances involving characters of little to no substance   it continues to work off the fact that what people in the past considered influential somehow and always seems to weasel its way  as a prominent piece of literature  into a time period like today where it does not belong   im sure many people read the prophet  but it does not enrich or enlighten them in the least  and if it does it is for a brief period of time   all that was read is assumedly forgotten within minutes after it is all comprehended  to some little extent   not bringing down the moral values this book addresses  just a dose of reality for those thinking this is revolutionary and possibly neccessary in an evil  cynical  sarcastic  and perplexing time period we find ourselves in now   sorry  just a heads up  read it to heed it |4.0
aennw2g826191|its a thin book  very readable and has interesting 1 2 page thoughts on various entities like anger  children  religion  speech  silence and its cool         reading  ofcourse if one needs to imbibe the thoughts of the  author  it has to be consumed slowly and perhaps revisited but leaves you  pretty heady and clear about certain things |3.0
a1kq80y692cdoi|i read this about a year ago and can t recall a great deal of the book  from what i do recall it was like a poem all the way through  while the writing was beautiful  i found it ambiguous and befuddled with meaning that i could not identify with  when gibran speaks of god  i cannot identify because i have since abandoned those philosophies  it is thus difficult to revisit them in this book  i have the feeling a may have missed something great about this book  indeed  i pulled wisdom from parts  but rather than go back and read it again  for now  perhaps i will move on to another of the many books out there that are enlightening and worth reading  someday  i would like to read this again and dig deeper |2.0

a21sz8urizfdrw|being a child of the 60 s  i first read this book in college  years later when my daughter went off to school  i gave her my well worn  tattered copy of this beloved book  recently we have been faced with some health challenges  and i turn again to the beautiful words written so long ago by an author with a simply beautiful presence  and once again it brings me peace and understanding |5.0

aipvxnlga5yuy|i ve read this book a few times and it always takes me away from the petty worries of everyday life to a place where universal truth seems to exist  this is surprising as i don t believe in universal truth but in a world of competing truths  depending on your perspective  how does gibran do this  it s the simple  poetic language and use of metaphor which makes this book seem timeless some people have said he s helped to inspire the arab spring and that he s a revolutionary  others say he s irrelevant and full of pop psychology   but he remains the third most popular poet in the world so go figure another book i read recently had a similar prophet  a woman called bal ashtu   calling for equality between men and women in islam  it was called  mosaic deceptions  i think  worth a read too if you re interested in spiritual themes and a good plot in the same book |4.0
a2m7r6tnmh5yzn|maybe some of the folks in his homeland considered him a   34 prophet   34  but i see him as an other person with some ideas but not too many truths  that being said  i like many of his ideas and concepts  if you like spiritual gurus like eckhardt tolle you ll probably like kahlil gibran |3.0
a1hq32ho9bqr7z|this book transcends all religions  and explains the many questions we have about life through what seems like a channeled spiritual source   this book is not long  but says so much is so few words   highly recommended  |5.0
a37473rzr4wohk|while it is certainly true that gibran was no christian  is it necessarily true that his beautiful writings are heresy   no   his messages of unconditional love and tolerance are universal  regardless of your faith   it is certainly necessary to understand his perspective   but to discount his contributions out of hand on the basis of his personal beliefs is deeply prejudicial |5.0
a1npngwbvd9ak3|this is one of the first  literary  books i recall reading  my mother kept a collection of gibran s works that she often read  i was curious to see what attracted her  so i looked into them too   i was either eight or nine  at the time   i believe that was my first taste of spirituality and seemed  at the time more relevant than what i was being force fed by nuns in  catechism class  rereading gibran now  i m struck by the notion that hesse  must have been aware of these texts before he wrote siddhartha  they  contain many of the same themes  no one else can guide you on your path   you must select your own course  preachers and prophets are a dime a dozen   true wisdom comes from within the prophet s teaching on love is  particularly relevant to me at this stage of my life  quot for even as  love crowns you so shall he crucify you  even as he is for your growth so  is he for your pruning  even as he ascends to your height and caresses your  tenderest branches that quiver in the sun  so shall he descend to your  roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth  like sheaves of corn  he gathers you unto himself  he threshes you to make you naked  he sifts  you to free you from your husks  he grinds you to whiteness  he kneads you  until you are pliant  and then he assigns you to his sacred fire  that you  may become sacred bread for god s sacred feast  quot look into these  books  they may appear simplistic to the jaundiced eye  but they may also  provide the inspiration you need to see you through life s travails |5.0
a1ty6fnld3psrq|this book redefines poetry and re introduces a long forgotten era where people once spoke with meaning and passion  instead of politics  money and regulations  the prophet reminds you of wisdom we as people once had embraced but now over look and under estimate the value of what real knowledge is worth  this book gives u all of this in less than 100 pages  i m not getting paid to write this review  so this is a real review from a real person and not a salesman  if this was helpful then send me 5 bucks and we ll call it even  paypal accepted|5.0
ajtto7fn4px80|first read this when i was 14 years old   now several decades later  i just reread this while sitting and waiting during karate lessons and other children s sports activities   it brought me back again to the mountains of idlewild  above palm springs where i first read his words while at church camp   it brought me back to that place of center  balance and peace   profoundly wise and insightful     i loved the way his words washed over me  filling all of the corners of my heart   would recommend this to all lovers of words and soul seekers     of any age   this is ageless and priceless   thanks kahlil for another lovely visit |5.0

a20biprpd473rd|i received my first copy of the prophet a million years ago when i was a somewhat precocious 12 year old  i still have that copy  now  i find young people who i believe will benefit from these writings and pass it along  probably best first offered at ages 14 16 and certainly at any age beyond  i must admit  i don t understand the new cover  the original was so much more appropriate  thankfully  the text remains intact  gibran has been quoted so often that  to some  parts may seem oddly familiar  like an overused catch phrase  however  in context  gibran s thoughts remain utterly profound  like biblical text that one reads and re reads  one is challenged by the understandings that gibran s writings promote and that can only be achieved through experience over time  definitely a treasured companion |5.0
a1l5ig1lkn6ned|this is one of the best  most inspiring philosophy poetry books ever written   i have read it over and over  though never tire of it   it is a great reminder for what s most important in life and puts everything in perspective   my favorite  chapters  are love  marriage  children and the first look  i am a romantic though  so the other chapters may appeal to you more         absolutely classic and timeless   perfectly stands the test of time  my personal copy is from 1948 and is one of my favorite treasures |5.0
a3om311dlnwbf|one of my favorite philosophers  love his words  his ancient wisdom is still relevant today  worth keeping this wonderful pearl of wisdom |5.0
a2u31h5n3l2faf|i had been seeing quotes from this all over the place for the last year while reading other books  i figured since all my favorite authors were quoting gibran  i should check out the original  it s quite amazing how much wisdom is packed into a relatively short book  every page makes you think and reflect on your own life  i will definitely be going back and re reading this again and again  i can tell it s one of those books that you ll find a new treasure or a deeper insight with every read  a spiritual classic and a must read for every christian and spiritual philisophical seeker trying to understand the depth  mystery  beauty and struggles of life |5.0

a393ejd130usd6|intrinsically  this book utilizes a flowing a cleaver way to express the ideological interpretations of the author  while  personally  i found nothing profound in the ideologies expressed in the book  i did find it  simply a pleasure to read  even with the lack of philosophical epiphany  the style of the book in its fluid manner  the parallel structure of the chapters  and the brevity combined with the larger font in the piece  leave the reader  whether they agree with the philosophies therein or not  in a state of solemn peace and the feeling that they have not wasted their time  as  really  they probably have not  it really did not waste my time anyway  it only took a little over an hour to read  with breaks  |5.0

a133s8cuivrfkn|when i first started writing poetry at age 12 or 13  i was encouraged to read other poets   something i refused to do because i thought it might influence   my style      ok  so i was hard headed     i later was introduced by a brother in law to kahlil gibran and it was like finding a kindred soul   i now totally encourage any one that want s to excel in poetry to read the greats   and you won t find many of the caliber of this man     his words sing from the page both in his poetry and in his short stories   i love  martyr s to man    it s been a while but some of the words are still singed in my brain     and i think it truly speaks of the time we are living in now more than ever     from memory so not verbatim   are you a soldier who must forsake wife and children and go fourth into the fields of battle for the sake of greedwhich your leaders miscall duty than you are a martyr to man there s more but the gist of what i am saying is if you love poetry and you haven t read any kahlil gibran you re missing out on one of the greatest poets to ever live and if you write poetry  i firmly believe kahlil gibran should be recquired reading   not that you will feel you have to plod your way through it   you too  will fall in love with his immense gifts   sincerely and best wishes to allchase vonyour chance to hear the last panther speak|5.0

a3bhsr8lon67na|this book was great  each chapter was a nugget of wisdom  resulting in a treasure trove by the end  it s no wonder this book is called a classic  gibran uses a literary style inspired by the bible  but it is still easy to read  has a lot of philosophical ideas that i m sure i will revisit in the future  seems like one of those books that you learn something new every time you reread it  definitely recommend  especially for anyone new to philosophy reading because it is short and easy to read |5.0

a3is4wgmfr4x65|the prophet is kahlil gibran s best known work in the western world with over 25 million copies sold  it is said that kahlil spent more than 20 years writing the prophet and held onto the manuscript for 4 years before finally releasing it for publication  kahlil referred to the prophet as the  strange little book  or  the little black book  in reference to its cover  the working title of this strange little book was  the counsels    the final version consisting of 26  verses  in the prophet the philosophy of east and west meet in a union unparalleled in the literature of the early 20th century  kahlil acknowledged that he was inspired by a multitude of writers and that is evident throughout the prophet  most notably the visions of william blake  who kahlil referred to as  the poet prophet par excellence   incidentally one of kahlil s mentors the sculptor rodin called kahlil the 20th century blake   the prophet was also heavily influenced by the bible  buddhism  hinduism  the english romantics  ralph waldo emerson  walt whitman  friedrich nietzsche  ameen rihani  and christian and sufi mysticism when the prophet was first published the early 20th century critic claude bragdon wrote of its   extraordinary dramatic power  deep erudition  lightning like intuition  lyrical lift and metrical mastery with which the message is presented  and the beauty  beauty  beauty  which permeates the entire pattern   wow that s a powerful critique   and let s listen to his close friend and one of his biographers mary haskell who wrote to kahlil after she received a copy of the prophet  beloved kahlil  the prophet came today  and it did more than realize my hopes  for it seemed in its compacted form to open yet further new doors of desire and imagination in me  and to create about itself the universe in nimbus      this book will be held as one of the treasures of english literature  and in our darkness we will open it to find ourselves again and the heaven and earth within ourselves  generations will not exhaust it  but instead  generation after generation will find in the book what they would fain be   and it will be better loved as men grow riper and riper  it is the most loving book ever written  i can add little more than that   other than haskell had a very good point |5.0

a39fw2wg64tqgo|i m afraid that if i write too much in this review  it will be longer than the actual book  heavily padded with white space and clever type  maybe the editors had massive thumbs and a knack for quickly flipping through pages as they speed read through nonsense  so their thumbs don t cover the words there are just several places where this book starts to bring an interesting point to the table  most notable  for me  was saying  you are as weak as your weakest link is only half of the story  you are also as strong as your strongest link   this was quickly lost in conversation about how the ocean and the river are one  and something about white and black string on cloth  and a bending willow tree  excessive use of the word  verily   and other tiresome metaphors two stars because i was able to finish it  although at less than 100 pages  that s not really a challenge  i think people like this book because they can t understand it  and assume that it s wise  maybe they can t understand it because it sucks |2.0
a386a9we42m4pg|i adore this book and must have misplaced it somewhere   i was curious to see how the kindle version was  due to things like formatting issues that sometimes occur   disappointingly  the free sample is only the forward   not even one page of the book   the price is not bad in comparison to some kindle editions  but the sample definitely didn t let me check out the book at all |1.0

awlfvct9128jv|gibran khalil gibran was born in 1883 in what is now northern lebanon   in 1909 he went to paris to study  but he did not like the strict education  and so he traveled  eventually moving to new york   gibran became both an artist and a writer  and in 1923 he published  the prophet   which is generally considered to be his greatest work   he died of cancer in a new york hospital at the very young age of 48 the prophet is a story about almustafa  the prophet  who after living 12 years in orphalese is about to depart aboard ship to return to his home   before he goes  a group of people stop him  and to them he teaches the secrets of life   gibran writes in a very poetic manner  and it is wonderful to read |5.0
a8pgx8cxna527|the prophet took me by surprise   i had received it as a gift and owned it for many years before i ever read it and when i started it  i thought i d be reading a fun fable   what i got instead was an amazing look into my own soul  told with a beauty and grace i have not found in any other work   it is a fable  but it is so much more   the subtle lessons about life and love and our journey through this existence are captivating  it is the type of book that has so much to teach that i usually only read a few pages at a time   and they always seem to be the right pages just when i need them   of course  you can read it the whole way through  but give yourself time to savor the experience i think this book fits perfectly with one of my other favorites that i also savor and read often   working on yourself doesn t work by ariel and shya kane is a practical guide on finding and keeping lasting fulfillment   both books allowed me to see life from a totally unique perspective  but the kanes  book has been the catalyst for a transformational shift into a life i never would have thought possible  do yourself a favor and get both books and enjoy them   your experience of life will be richer for having done so |5.0

a33cnfk776mtwr|i didn t really know what to expect when i purchased this  i knew only that it was a well regarded book  and that it was said to be full of wisdom what i found was a story that was easy to read  there are few words per page  covering the sayings of a wise man as he speaks to those around him  there is a kind of poetry in the words  but not the kind that is difficult to understand  the insights were both familiar and refreshing  it made me reconsider my notions of all aspects of life  although it was less a spiritual revolution than a gentle awakening i bought the hardcover  it is small and sits easily in one hand  the pages are made from a rich feeling  textured paper that feels nice to the fingertips  and the text is printed in spacious and easy to read letters  throughout the book are scattered drawings that kahlil gibran made  i like them  i feel they add to the experience of reading this book  although i can t quite put my finger on the reason while spiritual  it does not  as far as i could tell  convey any beliefs specific to any religion or even assume a readily recognizable god  gibran says       the wind speaks not more sweetly to the giant oaks  than to the least of all the blades of grass    pp 27 28   the notion of god that emerges from these pages is of a pervasive connectedness or oneness with nature and the universe |5.0
a1mcahde1f3q6l|as the author of a spiritually themed book entitled  the misadventures of sister mary olga fortitude   i appreciate any book that opens the doors to spiritual understanding  there are few contemporary books that will do this for you in such a poetic way this is a book containing eternal truths  it was given to me as a high school graduation present many years ago  at the time  i found it beautiful  but i couldn t understand it  that is because i hadn t experienced life selections from this book were read at my wedding  the sections on love speak of what it is truly about  most of us never have an inkling of what true love is since we are caught up in a world of attachment to illusions and delusions  this book will help you to break through them this is a classic that will stand the mark of time such as the bible has done  kahlil gibran is an old soul who speaks in a language that can be embraced by people of any faith the book is filled with metaphors and parables  it is almost as if jesus himself is speaking through the author  whether or not you will be able to comprehend what the author is speaking about  the prophet will plant seeds that can bear good fruit davis aujourd hui  author of  the misadventures of sister mary olga fortitude |5.0

a34hcszjxzlpc|okay i know that gibhran is supposed to be corny and cliched and assosciated with the hippy movement of the 60 s it does not mean that he also isn t still relevant to anyone seeking answers to what life is about  the set up is simple   as a prophet takes his leave of the people with whom he has stayed for many years  he is asked a series of questions   tell us of friendship  of love  of work  of death   and to each question the prophet provides an answer for me the message that the prophet provides is that life is not easy and that the greatest joys can only be achieved by risking and enduring great sorrow but that is only what i took from gibran and his prophet  read and take your own message from his words |5.0
