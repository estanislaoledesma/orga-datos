539291,"B001BDDT8K","AF3BYMPWKWO8F","Joe MacBu",6,6,1,1229558400,"Warning: Contains Menadione","According to the manufacturer's website, this (and many of their other products) contains menadione sodium bisulfite complex.<br /><br />Menadione is a synthetic precursor for Vitamin K and has been reported to have toxic effects. The use of menadione over the natural alternatives (such as leafy greens and kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food. It's surprising that pet food at this high of a price actually contains this substance.<br /><br />Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.<br /><br />A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione ""produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung."" Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.<br /><br />Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.<br /><br />Do an online search for menadione and you'll find more info from a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of this substance.<br /><br />In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I would advise you to avoid feeding this to your cats."

BOSS ""AEB""",2,2,3,1217980800,"Not enough better than bottled dressings to be worth the extra bother","I normally use a zesty Italian bottled dressing (store brand) to which I have added extra garlic and olive oil, although I sometimes make a dressing from scratch using olive oil and lemon juice with herbs.<br /><br />I followed the directions on the package for 'classic vinagrette' using extra virgin olive oil and wine vinegar. When I put my normal amount of dressing on my salad (barely moist), it tasted about about the same as unaltered bottled dressing; increasing the amount of dressing on the salad until it was very wet with dressing standing in the bottom of the dish improved the flavor and it was slightly better than the altered bottled dressing.<br /><br />My conclusion was that although the Napa Valley dressing mix made a good dressing, it was not enough better than the store brand bottled dressing to justify the extra work and higher cost."

Akridge ""AlwaysThinking""",0,0,3,1350950400,"Too much sugar","I have been making ginger tea by grating fresh ginger, mixing it with honey and lemon and adding boiling water. The qualities and effects of ginger on the body are quite remarkable. My husband and I have been battling the flu for 10 days, and the ginger tea really helps. It was getting tiring doing that by hand, so I found this product and decided to give it a try.<br /><br />Here are my thoughts:<br />Pros:<br />It's quite tasty, although very sugary. For me, as I love the taste of ginger drinks (ginger beer, ginger ale) I like the combination of ginger with sweetness, although I would prefer it to be artificial sweetener. I found that I need more than 6 to 8 ounces of water due to the concentration in each of the packets.<br />It's very nice that each packet is individually sealed, which keeps it fresh for quite a while.<br /><br />Cons:<br />It's very high in sugar. It's a peppery, sugary drink. I believe it will supply you with the necessary amounts of ginger to affect your health in a positive way. Here's the but though, because it's high in sugar, it's something that someone like I, who have higher than normal cholesterol would not want to consume too much off.<br /><br />So in conclusion, I liked the taste, but would prefer less sugar, or artificial sweetener. Perhaps sweetened with honey?"

I've probably ordered at least 10 boxes.  Crisped soybeans = good texture + lots of protein... what a great idea!  I will say 4 stars because I have noticed some variation in quality sometimes, but they have never been inedible."

I love the way that it tasted and I felt like it was good for me too. I do not really like nutty products but I do love almonds so this was perfect for me.

But then I understand that ""taste"" is very subjective.  So why did I give this 5 stars?<br /><br />1) Its small.  Very small.  You can but it in a bag or purse and not notice its there.  I will use these when traveling, for sure.  Space is the issue here folks!<br /><br />2) The Ingredients are: Coffee (100% Arabica), Lowfat Milk, Sugar, Cocoa Powder, Potassium Bicarbonate, Cellulose Gel, Potassium Citrate, Cellulose Gum, Carrageenan.  You will expect to get these in all canned coffees.<br /><br />3)  It is 8.45 fl ounces, has 100 Calories, 1.5 g fat, 4 grams of protein, 19 carbs.  Its like a little meal in a can.<br /><br />4) Tastes better than any of the other coffees out there, including canned Starbucks."
