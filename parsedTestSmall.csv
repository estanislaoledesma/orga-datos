ai9cmlqwh9krp|the prophet by kahlil gibran is a very beautiful  inspiring writing which really resonated within me  it felt as truth  i feel that with good patience and deep contemplation  this book can lead you to a profound understanding of your own life and all others around you i first read about kahlil gibran in a book calledthe lost teachings of atlantis  that book answered all my spiritual questions about the meaning of life  who and what we are and more in a very easily understandable manner and all of it corresponds with the writing of kahlil gibran  i highly recommend reading that book also |5.0
a2nhd7luxvgtd3| the prophet  is a short read  my copy checks in at just under 100 pages   but its berevity belies both the power and beauty of gibran s words   at its simplest  it is a discourse on the human condition  love  work  joy and sorrow  crime and punishment  reason and passion  gibran runs the gamut of emotion and being  laying bare the paradox of who we are as human beings   while the tone is somewhat mystical  which i didn t really care for   the sheer poetic beauty of his writing moved me for example  in the chapter  love   gibran writes       when love beckons to you  follow him    though his ways are hard and steep    and when his wings enfold you yield to him    though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you    and when he speaks to you believe in him        for even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you   even as he is for you growth so is he for your pruning        the contrast  vivid metaphor and beautiful images were stunning and left me with much to think and reflect on about my own life  and the choices i ve made   it would be going too far to say that  as a result of reading  the prophet  i ve had an epiphany or  to take it to a ridiculous conclusion  some sort of a conversion   rather it has caused me to consider on a philosophical level what it is to be human means to me  and how i have demonstrated my  human ness  in my life part poetry  part philosophy  it is simultaneously thought provoking and emotional   undeniably readers will have a visceral reaction  although  apparently given the reviews of some  not all reactions are positive    highly recommended  if only to cause one to examine their own life   after all   the unexamined life is not worth living  |5.0
a1k1jw1c5cusuz|the prophet is about a mysterious religious thinker who is about to leave for his native land   before he goes  many people have just one question to ask him   in a very few words  he tells them his accumulated wisdom primarily in a nondenominational way   the only exceptions come in the references to rebirth   the essence of each brief lesson is that we have to step outside of our own perspective to see things in the way that god does and wants us to let me give you an example   when someone transgresses either man s laws or god s laws  we tend to condemn the person harshly and focus on punishment   this is like treating the person as though they have fallen below some level of what it is still to be human   yet no one does anything worse than what some person has done wrong before and will do wrong again surely  our reaction should still focus  like a mother s  on the fundamental humanness of the person and our desire to have the person be a contributing  loving  and helpful part of our community another way to think about the lessons of the prophet is to notice that nature loves a balance   if we interfere with nature  nature overreacts in some new way that counters our interference   this happens when we put too much phosphate into lakes   algae blooms expand exponentially to eat the phosphate   these lessons help us to see the balance that is missing in our initial reaction a good parallel can be found in the study of the brain   our initial reactions when frightened or threatened are focused in the oldest parts of the brain   this part of the brain triggers strong chemicals to be released that engage us in  quot fight or flight quot  reactions that can save our lives in the near term   in the  quot civilized quot  world  we often have these reactions just to stress   gibran is helping us move to our highest level of consciousness by choosing our reactions  and selecting reactions that integrate all parts of our brains plus our near  and long term best interests as individuals and as a community many eastern religions encourage one to become free of the conscious mind  and that sense of objectivity is captured nicely here   i have a feeling much like when meditating while i read the prophet  because of its calming influence on my overreactive senses i also think of this perspective like being on the moon and observing the circumstances on earth through a telescope   with such extreme distance should come detachment from the ego  to permit good thinking but none of these perspectives are directly suggested or alluded to   the moral lessons are simply there  with the briefest possible examples to make them clear   as such  they are masterpieces of good thinking  moral ethics  and fine communication the answers are so brief and so profound that you will want to discuss them   i suggest you select another member of your family  or a group of people from your house of worship   the lessons are best explored by discussing tangible situations that you face every day   certainly  it is desirable and appropriate to consider the direct teachings of your religious heritage and beliefs in this connection whenever you feel overwhelmed  turn to the page in the prophet that addresses your issue   like taking a warm bath  you will be soothed by the love for humanity in the answers gibran provides before you speak  ask yourself who is about to speak for you and what do they want |5.0

a3a0zk5gthscuv|i plan to buy 3 more copies from amazon  for my departing son   distant friends last night  i made a mad dash to get a copy of this book  ten minutes before the book store closed  because i couldn t find my old one   i had been trying unsuccessfully for weeks to send out an sos to a life long friend whose comforting presence i really needed  even if just by phone   long  sun lit walks through my beautiful neighborhood lined with 100  year old oaks  magnolias  elms  and maple trees  did not make me feel any better   at home  the news is only reporting the political and ecomonic turmoil going on world wide  or the oscars  the latter which i could care less about   it was a very sad and loney moment back in miami i would naturally hit the beach  or watch the ocean from my balcony and forget the world   so  in desperation  i jumped in my vehicle  hit the book store  and called on the wisdom of mr  gibran   i sipped a glass of red  kicked back on my couch  and slowly read aloud each blessed passage on all the areas of life and the challenges they can present   i don t know why  but this book always makes me cry at the beginning and smile at the end   in little over an hour i d read slowly through each page  and felt 100  better on physical inspection  this would be the student slackers paradise book report choice   but don t be so easily deceived  because this book packs more useful information than any 50 pound college textbook  without the endless verbage of a 1 000 page russian novel it is small  the paper of good weight and quality  the ones i always purchase  at least   the print is big and the illustrations done by mr  gibran are simple yet humana and divinical   the words are brief and powerful  comforting and idiot proof   perfect healing food for the love starved yet attention deficit crazy world we now live in   i was first given this book by a friend  as a departing gift for a 7 000 land sea voyage  back in 1983 i hope to be there for my friend should he ever need me   i sent this book to him as my comforting presence |5.0

a38aapxsjn4c5g|echoing the reviews of others   it is obvious that gibran both was inspired by and inspired many of the great writers of all ages   from buddha to coehlo  and countless others in between  there is a depth of truth and a veil of simplicity that  once lifted  opens the mind  heart and soul to universal wisdom it is not hard to understand why gibran was as popular in his day  and in the 1960 s  as he was   covering the landscape from religion to love  gibran bubbles up deep truths in the form of a farewell speech from the prophet to the people of his city before he sets sail on a final journey   the metaphors are numerous and the scale of depth is exceptional the book itself is nearly 100 pages  but the content is not readable at any level rapidly   this book is one that bears constant revival and renewal   it s a well that provides the reader with sweet water of wisdom which merits frequent draws to slake the thirst a must have and a must read |5.0

appyzyq7uansb|being raised both lutheran and catholic  i knew religion  prayer  the tenets  etc  sang in choirs and even taught religion from high school through my 30 s  but it wasn t till i read  the prophet  by kahlil gibran did i find spirituality and the serenity peace within me  even in the midst of chaos  his writings taught me to slow down and listen in silence to the inner whisperings of my soul where i found  me   each individual passage is a life lesson  so eloquently written  and yet so simple in belief that you gain and accept your  self     your destiny in this earthly adventure  you ll find that you will pick it up often  no matter what your beliefs or situation need  for it will give you the answers you seek until you know them so well  it almost will become a way of life    the inner peace to deal with even the most tragic of circumstances  when my young husband unexpectedly died  the passage on death was such a comfort  in memory of him  i have given each of the brothers  sisters  daughters and granddaughters a copy  to know the way of life by the right path which he led by virtually every passage as a man of incredible character  and greatly honored in both life and death  and this earthly life can t get any better than that   kahlil gibran  thank you  |5.0

afy0bt42ddyzv|these days  kahlil gibran s  the prophet  often gets dismissed as  hippie  literature  yet  this book had been a bestseller long before the 1960s  originally published in 1923  it almost instantly became a hit and even did well through the great depression  today  gibran s claim to fame is being the third best selling poet of our time  behind shakespeare and lao tzu    and pretty much entirely based on sales of this book  when his publisher  alfred knopf was asked who the audience for the book was  he flippantly dismissed the question   it must be a cult   he retorted yet there is no such cult  what s incredible is that there s absolutely no marketing hype behind the success of this book  gibran himself is long gone  there is no political  religious  or commercial enterprise attached to his name bent on winning souls and or profits  the gibran estate has merely been licensing copies year after year in response to the demand   a demand fueled pretty much entirely by word of mouth and chance discovery  the fact is  the twenty six poems in this book have a surprising and suprassing relevance  insight and compassion  broken down into several topics   on love    on work    on joy and sorrow   etc   the book itself recounts the sermons of a fictional poet leaving behind the gift of knowledge before he leaves his homeland i first found gibran through a setting of his poem  on children  by local washington  d c  singers sweet honey in the rock on their album   breaths   your children are not your children they are the sons and daughters of life s longing for itself they come through you but not from you and though they are with you yet they belong not to you  at the time i was about to leave for college and eighteen years of living under my parent s roof had made me restless for autonomy  that poem eloquently expressed everything i was yearning to say to them in my hours of frustration and adolescent angst  it later proved to be a reference to turn to in times where i needed confidence to live an independent and fulfilling life  while still maintaining respect and compassion towards the parents who had raised me i am not exaggerating when i say that the poems in this book have kept me grounded and sane throughout some of the most troubling times in my life  our modern lives are ever hectic  stressful and busy   wrought with drama  frustration  depression  etc  the knowledge in these poems brings me back to a  middle ground    there is a sage wisdom and clarity in the poems that has often been helpful for me in  unwinding  and coming back to earth  they bring me back to a place of clarity from whcih i can see my life from a wider perspective though gibran himself was a christian and despite the title and conceit of the book  this is not really a religious book  the insight in this book would be applicable to your life even if you are an atheist  what s more  the poetry is mostly imagistic  do not expect the academic poetics of gibran s contemporaries eliot or pound or even frost  they are written with the aim of being accessible and immediate to the reader and rely mostly on clear metaphors and vivid imagery copies of  the prophet  are not hard to come by  perhaps check out the book s table of contexts either using amazon s  search inside  feature or in your local bookstore and see if it addresses a problem or issue you are dealing with  that s a good a place as any to start with  chances are  you will find something that speaks to you on some level |5.0

a11tyiltafkpr3|when gibran was first introduced to me  i had definite doubts that his work would be the ordinary  grab a dictionary sort of read  but when you first open to those sections that apply to you  and listen to the words as they roll off of your tongue and dance in your ears  well  shock is the only word for it  yes  the ideals and beliefs that he expresses in  the prophet  may not be anything new as far as philosophy is concerned  but the perfect blend of brilliant poetry and this simple philosophy come together to make something that is indeed  unique  i ve purchased countless copies to the ones that i know will love and understand his words  and if for nothing else  kahlil s work can be labeled as truly  a literary work of art |5.0

a2bqzra2p81bqg|the language is poetic  but it is not poetry   it works as prose poetry  in fact some of the best in english   that is probably because gibran somewhat mimics the poetry of the king james version   some phrases and turns and images are brilliant that said  what is the point of this book   there are some nice things    is not religion all deeds and all reflections      who can separate his faith from his actions      who can spread his hours before him  saying   this is for god and this is for myself  this for my soul  and this other for my body   good point   there are several such nuggets   but  you can tell why the hippie set loved this book  it is spirituality devoid of religion   namely  this book can make you feel all  cosmic  without all that pesky christian morality   that bit quoted above  it is followed by   he who wears his morality but as his best garment were better naked  ah   see what morals get you   on crime and punishment  we get this  it takes a village  gem   and as a single leaf turns not yellow but with the silent knowledge of the whole tree  so the wrong doer cannot do wrong without the hidden will of you all    see  crime is not the fault of the criminal  it is the fault of society    the righteous is not innocent of the deeds of the wicked    yea  the guilty is oftentimes the victim of the injured    see  if you self righteous rich folk didn t oppress the meek poor folk  they wouldn t have to commit crime i wonder how the injured rape victim victimized her guilty rapist generally  the twin credos of  the prophet  are  1  any path to god is the right path  and  2  if it feels good do it  1   thus  the pluralistic relativism of lines like  say not   i have found the truth   but rather   i have found a truth    say not   i have found the path of the soul   say rather   i have met the soul walking upon my path   forget that jesus said   i am the way  the truth  and the life  no man cometh unto the father  but by me     john 14 6  by the way    no  no  no   many willfully ignore that jesus said such un ecumenical things like this   the hippie jesus thinks that there are many paths to god   the whole  one source  many wells  philosophy   don t believe me   why do you think the folks at the jesus seminar blackballed this very verse  john 14 6     our great  loving  hippie jesus believes that everyone comes to  god  in his own way   he would never say that    blackball    that last quotation wasn t an actual quote  by the way   2   and  though the nature of the good and evil chapter is tempered by a sort of  love thy neighbor  philosophy  it still defines  good  not as following judaeo christian morals  or even a  do unto others  prescription  but  you are good when you are one with yourself  if it feels good to you  do it   sure  gibran later seems to warn against unbridled pleasure seeking   pleasure is a freedom song  but it is not freedom   it is the blossoming of your desires  but it is not their fruit    later   however  such hedonism is considered a path   a truth   to god  some of your youth seek pleasure as if it were all  and they are judged and rebuked   i would not judge or rebuke them   i would have them seek  thus the paradox of liberalism  the prophet rebukes you for rebuking those hedons amongst you   they are only on their path    you are so wrong to tell them that they are wrong    ah  relativism   the problem with unchecked hedonism   you are good when you are one with yourself   if you prefer  is that mankind always finds some inner reasoning to justify their evil actions   man always finds a way to make pleasure at any cost  devoid of anything else  his god i don t want to seem as if i am some stick in the mud  a prude  or an over moralizing and self righteous christian   christian i am  and hedon i sometimes am   i can get wheat from the chaff out of  the prophet    there is much here that is good  and some of it is artfully written   some of gibran s thoughts are even profound   still  there is much here that is bad  there is still some shuck on the ear  so to speak   sometimes you must take the wrong path which leads you to the right path  but there is just one right path  not several   gibran never seems to say that  and  since he was a lebanese christian  i find that sad there is much here to lead you astray i will not hold it against gibran that  the prophet  has inspired numerous imitations of lesser poetic talent  sad purveyances of even fewer truths   yes  i am speaking of  amongst others  the trite  inane cacophonies of paulo coelho and  for those reviewers and readers who think that  the prophet  is the most poetic  most enlightening  most cosmically spiritual tome of all time  try reading the psalms in the kjv with an open mind  yes   i invented the word  hedon     hedonist  sounds like a philosophical school  as does  epicurean    the latter  too  is for an aesthete   let s say a hedon is a pleasure seeker without the philosophy   a hedon is an unsophisticate   i probably made up that word too  |2.0

a1ijvxgqj7p1g1|i usually don t like getting books that i did not ask for  when someone buys a book for me  there is a certain obligation to actually read it  but doing so takes away time from the books i really want to read  there are so many books on my reading list and so little time to read them all that getting an unasked for book feels like someone actually stealing from me  stealing valuable reading time in the case of  the prophet   however  i did not resent the choice of my benefactor  even though i had not asked for it first of all  it was a very quick read  consisting of twenty nine poetic speeches by the fictional  prophet   he delivers them as his last word on various topics  since he is about to head back home after having lived in a foreign city for twelve years  and the people ask him to speak on all the important issues that touch on human life  family  food  work  emotions  economics  social problems  art  morality  spirituality  death  etc on most of these issues  the prophet takes what might be called an eastern stance  he stresses the importance of  letting go  rather than  taking charge   whether it s in relationship to your children  conflict situations  or the end of your life i did not find it necessary  however  to fully agree with this eastern outlook to appreciate the book  both for its poetic beauty and for inspiring thoughts  for whatever your own worldview  a degree of  letting go  is an art we can all learn   jacob schriftman  author ofjob s wager  an alternative to pascal s wager and the atheist s wager  with color illustrations |5.0

a1uye5c8vh3314|kahlil gibran s the prophet is a book that has touched many people very deeply since it s publishing in 1923   it has been translated into more than twenty languages  and the american edition alone has sold more than four million copies   it is considered both by gibran himself  and by the general public to be his literary masterpiece   the story is about a prophet leaving a town  and as he leaves he imparts some of his knowledge to the towns people   gibran himself was born in lebanon in 1883   he was a poet  artist  and philosopher   his fame and influence has spread through the world  superceding linguistic and cultural barriers   his poetry has been translated into more than twenty languages  and his drawings and paintings have been distributed and showcased all around the world   in the last twenty years of his life he lived in the united states  and began to write in english   the book the prophet was written during this time period   his words and pictures change the way that people look at life  and people find them to be an expression of the deepest impulses of man s heart and mind   the prophet is about a man who is leaving a small town called orphalese where he has made his home for the past twelve years   he has  for that time period  been waiting for a boat to take him back to the land of his youth   we are not told where that land is  only that he has been waiting to return there for twelve years   the entire book occurs on the date of his departure   as he is about to leave  the townsfolk stop him in the town and request that he tell them about certain things   he talks to them about life s lessons and imparts his wisdom to them   he is asked about giving  and he tells the people to give without recognition  because their reward is their own joy   he also talks about things like marriage  work  friendship and also love   he speaks about each  and more  describing the way that people should deal with each issue   this book is an interesting book   it is ninety three pages of life s lessons set down in writing   these are words to live by  and tell others to live by   this book is certainly a book that everyone should read   even if people don t agree with some of the beliefs  they should still read the book  if only to get their mind thinking about life  and it s many quandaries from a different perspective   this book is not unlike the musings of an aging man imparting his life s lessons to an audience of just about anyone whom he can gather to listen to him   i thoroughly enjoyed this book   it s lessons and stories are wise beyond the ages  and still hold up to be as true today as they were when gibran wrote them in 1923   the lessons enumerated within this pages are lessons that one would hope were followed by the general population  and i know that if more people read this book  then the world as a whole might become a more easily survivable place |4.0

a2op1hd9rgx5ow|this book is poetic myth a work of beauty whose every word drips a truth and a thought of knowledge reading it is like swimming in realitybut a reality i have not known till now kahlil kahlil gibran knew something we did not he shared a bit of the wonder of simplicity though this is merely the preaching of a prophet gibran is able to turn it into story and i feel from the gut for all the characters the prophet is unsurpassed in form in content best when speaking of beauty in ways i had never known and weakest when speaking of prayer certainly gibran relies on the story of jesus and throughout there are allusions to his wordsand actions but this is a new prophet who speaks the words of old though it be in new wineskin |5.0

a1ie6hlkmqo7gd|the prophet is a work of poetry  not in the sense that its goal is to rhyme or to cleverly match cadence and syllable counts between fragmented sentences  as most works of poetry seem aimed towards  but rather because it is simply written artfully   it isn t clever  it isn t witty  rather  there is simply a deepness to it that can literally surround the reader   there is no need for artifice or embellishment because the work is simply genuine  elegant  and powerful enough to transport the reader not to another   gt place lt    but to another   gt state lt     yes  it is a work of spiritual poetry   personally  i think that adds to the appeal  though one need not be interested in metaphysics or so called new age philosophy to enjoy it   regardless of one s perspective  it is very difficult not to find the prophet a beautiful book |5.0

akjcj46ap0s2a|this piece of literature promises enlightenment but fails to deliver   though the transient prophet indeed speaks eloquently and his words inspire deep reflection  they fail to impart true understanding   the initial discourse on love is riveting but what follows quickly descends into empty rhetorical musings which continue until the bitter end   the most entertaining aspect of this book is the artful use of language which almost masks the fact that the prophet indeed speaks but says nothing |2.0
a3kql4h6xzn1fh|gibran reveals the fundamental optimism that shapes the rest of his thinking in his response to one of the city judges  quot like the ocean is your god self it remains for ever undefiled and like the ether it lifts but the winged even like the sun is your god self it knows not the ways of the mole nor seeks it the holes of the serpent  quot this belief in a holy inner spiritual component of every man provides the foundation of such assertions as the moral nondistinction between criminal and victim  this may all sound good  but in practice has little to do with what we observe in the world around us  and is completely unworkable both individually and in society  the traditional christian view  boring though it may at first seem  is that there is no perfect holiness within us  rather  we holistic unities of imperfection and rebellion  granted  we consist of both material and immaterial substance  but the material and immaterial are inseperable except by death  gibran deals with the rational problems arising from his irreconcilable view of the sprit versus the world by  of course  positing reincarnation upon us christian theology deals with all the issues addressed by gibran  but without making us all out to be god  and without relying on the terrible concept of reincarnation  the only thing i can think of that would be worse than enduring a lifetime of suffering would be to endure an endless procession of lifetimes of suffering   sure  there are many wonderful  truthful passages in this book  but nobody should make the mistake of assuming it to be inspired  so let the reader beware |2.0

ayzlxlvmjgtjv|this book takes different themes such as work  love  etc  and poses them as questions that a community asks a wise man  who seems to be spirit talking  he is a man who is not so much of a religious base but more filled with a love of nature finding peace and depth through sensory and embracement of all dark and light  he is a person who has freedom in all areas of his life and learns from all things and all moments because of his openess and aliveness  he wants all people to gain awareness from their path thru eternity  this can be read in a variety of ways coming from each person s belief system  i read this when i was in a state of loss  loss of so much  this book can bring understanding and a shift in consciousness at least for a spell of time  it can expand who you are while you process and integrate his writings  i most definately recommend this book  for all people on their journey in whatever space they are in on their path of life |5.0

a1ww6itjsqp1tq|for years  i ve seen the prophet sitting on others  book shelves with the haunting face on the cover  and i always wondered what this book was about  then a friend laid it in my hands a few months ago just at a point in my life when i could actually grasp it  i read just one page and gibran s words were so beautiful  so powerful  so truthful that i had to get a copy of my own almustafa  the main character  is a prophet of god  he is christ  buddha  krishna  the higher self  he is the familiar soul that walks between heaven and earth in all humans and all creatures  as he is about to leave the city of orphalese to return  home   the people there sorrowfully beg him to share with them his wisdom  one by one they ask almustafa to speak of love  of children  of eating and drinking  crime and punishment  of houses and self knowledge  among other basic topics of life  his answers come in precisely crafted poetry that is deceptively simple  stunningly beautiful and potent in their spiritual depth  afmustafa s responses to the people of orphalese represent the distillation of gibran s own self mastery  his own unified consciousness  and spiritual awakening this short book should be read slowly and repeatedly until all its hidden truths are unveiled  even if it takes rereading it years after the first time  it is not only gibran s masterpiece  but his loving gift to the world  i m glad it took me 48 years to get to it  i would not have appreciated it until now |5.0

aphx2a37kdrah|my friend renee gave this to me a few years back and asked me to read the prophet   i started reading it shortly afterward and honestly had to stop for a little while because i tried consuming too much  sorry  my normal is history  historical fiction  and either sci fi or fantasy   after all  this is poetry and philosophy and should be consumed like a fine wine or excellent scotch  slowly savoring the flavor   having let things slip a little longer than intended i started reading it again  this time not trying to slam thru pages but rather reading one or two passages over lunch and seeing  the impact on me   this time things flowed somewhat better for me   the individual passages are nicely done covering aspects of life relevant to anyone   while i don t always agree with mr  gibran philosophy for a subject  some are particularly moving  for me in particular his passage on joy and sorrow was borderline earth shaking with his explanation of the relationship of the two  describing to me why both can be so strong rating this one is extremely complex   some passages touch you and make you think about your life or what you have  others flow over you  whether discarded for future consumption is to be determined later   because i wasn t touched by all  i call this a very strong 4 star book and can easily see why lovers of poetry or philosophy could call this a 5 star book   what i can say though is thank you renee for exposing me to the prophet |4.0
a1tr1lu2jszlul|this book was given to me as a gift before i journeyed overseas on a  spiritual quest to  quot find myself  quot  i never got a chance to read it  until one month after i was there and i had lost my job  my relationship  was very unsteady  and being so far form home  i felt completely isolated   after skipping around the book and reading sections that immediately  pertained to me at that point  i cried  not out of sadness  but out of  enlightenment   gibran wrote his experiences and his thoughts on life  but  they are such detailed poetic accounts  it applies to everyone at some  time  his writings have layers  and therefore this book can be read many  times over  and each time a new understanding will come   quot your pain is  the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding    quot |5.0

antggaqypswhf|i originally read this early in college and didn t think it was anything special then   i saw it recently in a used bookstore for two bucks  so i bought it it took about an hour to read there were about a dozen short passages i underlined   most of them weren t really revelations  but rather really good analogies i liked or uniquely descriptive ways of presenting commonly known truths |3.0
a1oy66gijtj3uh|if i could only keep one book in my library  it would be this one  i have  purchased many copies for loved ones and highly recommend it to anyone  occassionally compelled to make sense out of a world that often doesn t  make sense  personally  it stands as a reference to help me accept the  paradoxical nature of life   joy and sorrow  giving and receiving  reason  and passion  etc    and continuously brings me peace when life gets  chaotic  i love the fact that each chapter is so short  so while he says a  lot  it s easy to digest  i cannot recommend this book highly enough to  anyone of any faith on any kind of spiritual quest |5.0
adidqrllr4kbq|being an atheist  it may seem strange to some people that this book holds any meaning for me  but i think that  despite the religious references  people from all walks of life will relate to the poetic prose of the prophet kahlil gibran has been greatly celebrated in several countries for the book s simple yet biting phrases  any two sentences in this legacy of living can be made into a thought altering quote gibran uses a prose style throughout  short lines of words written as freestyle poetry create a rich medium to deliver his words each section has something poweful to say  but some of my favorites were those on work  giving  children  crime and punishment  freinds  time  and of course love as oppposed to most books containing the word  prophet  anywhere in the title  gibran expresses life as something to be enjoyed and soaked in as many ways as possible  the book does not stress the punishment of sins  but to bask in pleasure and not look back  decadence is not suggested  but the basic purpose of gibran s legacy is to tell us that life is short and must be lived without regrets it is a book that includes such beautiful metaphors and velvetty language that you are always sucked into reading  just one more section   what makes the book work is not just the simple genius of the author s statements  but also the beauty of his words  the flow of his language i hate to be like everyone else  in more instances than just this   but it does change you  it states what any prophecy should  and allows the religious aspects of the beliefs to take the backseat to the love of life and aspirations buy  read  and live by the prophet s words |5.0

a2x44aitmrtnc4|i can t think of a title fitting enough  what can you say about a book that you believe to be one of a kind  i have yet to find a book that i can compare it to  i suppose i could at least explain why i find this book to be so unique first of all this book covers most all of life s complex issues in the simplest fashion  and in that respect it is uncanny in presentation  secondly and astonishingly the author portrays a story of a prophet speaking to his people  but i cannot be so shallow to think that i am reading a said story    i am not reading the said story  what is actually happening is that i am the listener and kahlil gibran is the prophet himself   i strongly feel that if you the reader do not come away with this feeling yourself  you are probably reading some other book i think what would do justice in this review is to explain some feelings you may get from a brief reading  in fact with that said  i can state with confidence that many readers will peruse only a few pages at a time because the content is overwhelming in its ability to provoke thought and feeling  you may feel at times that some all important life questions are being answered  you may feel regret  like i did   i regret not having this book earlier in life to help me  i believe that a great many of you will feel amazed  it is truly amazing how such a short simple book can have such a profound impact on a person searching for answers to life s puzzles there is a quote from the  urantia book  that is appropriate in closing this review  the quote helps to sum up one of the unexpected feelings i received from this incredible story  and that quote is    the argumentative defense of any proposition is inversely proportional to the truth contained      and i give this quote because this book gives you the feeling that you are reading divine truth  i am a firm believer that if kahlil gibran is not a modern day prophet  no one is  and you too may come away with this belief because this is a story that really speaks to the heart of humanity  i cannot think of anyone who would not love this book |5.0
a2gfjqahe9kk4d|i ve always been wary of stories claiming ownership of principles of truth and wisdom  and attempting to package them in tidy  marketable portions for mass consumption   however  i found this novella unique and unpretentious in it s delivery of many truths that at first glance may appear intuitive  but in reality escape me in the daily practice of my life   it was a well written  thought provoking tale that helped me focus on the most important things of my daily life |5.0

a281npsimi1c2r|i am alive like you  and i am standing beside you close your eyes and look around  you will see me in front of you  gibran s words on his epitaphthe prophet captures the teachings of kahlil gibran in a comforting story that succinctly touches on everyday topics like love  giving  joy  sorrow  freedom  pain  teaching  friendship and beauty  within each tiny chapter  profound moments can occur as we are given insight into unfamiliar territory  a place of thought not commonly existing in daily life but familiar to spiritual teachers kahlil gibran magically explores the connection between sorrow and joy and how the deeper the sorrow you experience  the more joy you can contain  talking becomes thoughts that can no longer  dwell in the solitude of your heart  so they  live in your lips  as almustafa waits for a ship to take him back to the isle of his birth  he climbs a hill outside the city walls and looks out to sea  when his  ship arrives  he is suddenly filled with regret  yet knows he must follow his destiny and return home  long were the days of pain i have spent within its walls  and long were the nights of aloneness  and who can depart from his pain and his aloneness without regret  the priests and priestesses ask him to remain in very poetic ways   let not the waves of the sea separate us now  and the years you have spent in our midst become a memory  almustafa only cries and doesn t seem to speak until a woman named almitra appears  she is a woman who believed in him and he seems to have great fondness for her  we are not given any insight into their relationship  but his respect for her is unquestioned  she understands he must leave  but asks him to give the city his wisdom  she promises they will pass this wisdom down through the generations while viewing pictures of bsharri in northern lebanon  the mountains and the mist are almost a unique doorway into kahlil gibran s mind  he lived in a lush region where cascading falls  rugged cliffs and cedar trees influenced his art and writing we can imagine his thoughts of home and this book was actually first imagined when he wrote a short story as a teenager  a bostonian poet  josephine peabody  caught gibran s attention at an art exhibition and she later referred to him as  her young prophet    she also wrote poems about gibran s life and how she imagined his life in bsharri  his life is woven into his writing in the most beautiful ways  he names his book for a woman he loves and his writing is infused with spiritual teachings and influences from his journey from lebanon to new york the story has an unassuming plot  but the lessons are eternal and the ending is surprisingly tender  i was left with a sense of longing that is still drifting along with me like the mists of bsharri  the prophet is not just a book to read  it is a spiritual journey to experience  it may take three or more days to complete the reading of this tiny book  i could only read about a third at a time because it is saturated in wisdom and many of the chapters want to be read and read again  until they are absorbed into your soul and written on your heart  but if you love and must needs have desires let these be your desires to melt and be like a running brook thatsings its melody to the night    kahlil gibran the rebecca review|5.0

amkzhbok7vmqr|i recently reread this after many years and found the words to resonate with wisdom and spiritual centeredness  the book can be enjoyed and read with profit by people from all faiths and traditions  each will find some treasure that speaks to their heart  there is nothing in the prophet that would contradict or conflict with any of the sacred texts of the world s major religions  it somehow encompasses the teachings of all of them in a secular and beautiful work of literature |5.0

ald1cruby1365|this book was a philosophical touchstone for insecure boomers of the mid 1970s  everybody i knew in those days had to be able to discuss it intelligently or risk being thought to have a gap in our characters as people  a folk  talking blues singer of that era  i forget who  referred to this book in a lyric     a copy of kahlil gibran s  the prophet  with all the significant passages highlighted  the whole damn book was highlited    in truth  the whole phenomenon was symptomatic of the societal immaturity of my generation as young adults  it taught us all sorts of theoretical concepts of human nature that were not necessarily reflective of the real world  consideration  the dignity of each person  peace  love  repudiation of prejudice  all of this in a world that anything but reflected such beliefs in gibran s day  and except for the hippy dippy pseudo enlightenment we tried to cram down the world s throat in our day  our peculiar era was no better  we just used gibran and other such philosophers to peer pressure one another into self defeating meekness  if someone you knew was erudite enough to understand philosophy but didn t have the moxie to stand up to people when he should  gibran was the ideal way to make him a bona fide doormat and make him think he liked it  i won t even try to speculate how  relevant  gibran is nowadays  from the perspective of a sadder but wiser man  or at least not quite as stupid  i give you this sting lyric from the song  consider me gone  for consideration  to search for perfectionis all very wellbut to wait for heavenis to live here in hell |1.0

a3gvv56kujckq2|i  seem  to  have  adopted  much  of  my  thought   and  thinking   of  gibran  when  i  seemed  to  listen  to  the  silences   and  the  wisdoms  of  his  words and  he  seemed  to  translate  the  sound   and  the  silence  within  my  mind   as  if  to  say     he  was  teaching  me  how  to  better  listen   and  know  my  heart   and  my  joy   i  am  a roman  catholic   and  even  my  priest  had  a hard  time  trying  to  listen  and  hear  gibran   and  even  more  so  a  preacher  seems  to  say  gibran  esteems  himself  above  christ wich  i  know  gibran  ackwowledged  christ    may  so  he  seemed  to  have  memorized  the  psalms   at  the  age of  eleven   went  to the  college  of  art  in  paris   and  seemed  to  have  an  understanding   of  christ on  a  man  from  the  19th  centuryby  kahlil gibran jesus  the  son  of  man poet   and writer   stephen  a   brisenoi  memorized  the  prophet  at  the  age  of  fifteen   onlynow  i  can  contemplate  the  words   and  the  heart  of a  good  friend   and  poetthank  you  kahliland  to  my  father  for  letting  me  read  it  at  14 |5.0

ahd101501wcn1|i can never quite make up my mind on this book  i read it years ago and was also somewhat puzzled by it  rereading it i feel vague inspiring feeling  and the other a kind of vague repulsion  i see many many readers are inspired by the work  i myself feel it to be a kind of sentimental popular mixture of whitman and zarathustra  but without the great lyric sweeping of the former or the fierce intellectual irony of the latter i believe the most famous section of the work of twenty  six poetic essays is the one on  love here is some of this  love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself love possesses not nor would it be possessed for love is sufficient unto love when you love you should not say   god is in my heart   but rather  i am in the heart of god  and think not you can direct the course of love  for love  if it finds you worthy  directs your course love has no other desire but to fulfil itself but if you love and must needs have desires  let these be your desires  to melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night to know the pain of too much tenderness to be wounded by your own understanding of love and to bleed willingly and joyfully to wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving to rest at the noon hour and meditate love s ecstasy to return home at eventide with gratitude and then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise upon your lips i am reminded when i read this of bellow s description of the healer in  seize the day  dr  temkin  on the one hand he says and thinks that it is phony    and on the other he hears certain things and says   true   true   i must admit my reaction remains mixed  i do not feel it is really poetic truth of the highest value  but i do not feel it is without value either |4.0

aqs26f7r0kp2i|one of my greatest regrets is not reading my parents  copy in the 24 years of my life before i finally read  quot the prophet quot    kahlil gibran has convincingly rebutted that sector of society that tells us to limit our horizons  to make prejudgements about others  and to confine our existence inside an asphyxiatingly narrow box  seeing nothing but black and white  in my humble opinion  the prophet has declared that gray is the color of life |5.0
a34mvxqfiogc4f|i have loved his  writings since adolescence and i now have grandchldren  and i am still in love with the breathtaking beauty of gibran s poetry and stories and art  he is a master at inspiring one to reflect and revise and revisit their own spirituality and kinship with god |5.0

a2utkya2u8542f|like watching an olympic athlete or listening to an accomplished singer reading khalil gibran is in many ways indescribeable in that way  it s good that many of the other reviewers have tried to describe this book by giving anectodes of how it personally touched them   but ultimately those anectodes are like the stories of people who ve gone to some great vacation spot sure  they can tell you how they felt enjoying its weather or appreciating its beauty but such descriptions will never compare to you taking your own personal journey there because of the way this book is written  some of its passages will no doubt touch you more than others but it is beyond doubt that you will emerge touched and having that rare feeling of connecting with someone only through the medium of the printed word i wish we could award more than five stars   i wish it could be an infinity   for every heart touched by this wonderful  wonderful book |5.0

a145zphz2w33z1|i turn to the prophet for perspective whenever life gets distorted and seems to be on its own track  this book offers poetic and visionary commentary on some of the most vital points of living  and does so in a creative  thought provoking way  i first learned of kahlil gibran and the prophet during a sermon at a unitarian universalist church  and i ran to get the book  it s occupied an important place on my bookshelf ever since  it helps me realize that life is a process  and letting go is a big part of moving forward  it also reminds me to be mindful of how i think about and interact with the world  it keeps things in perspective  the prophet is an inspirational read |5.0

augz7eud67rom|i picked up this book later in life after many family hardships befell me   rather than looking to religion or self help books an honest and humble friend read versus from this book to me   having loved poetry and free verse most of my life i was struck with vivid beauty in the simplicity of the words that graced my ears that night   kahlil gibran in his day was renowned for his prose and how he carried it with the same simplicity that met my ear that night   in his finest work he left an indelible mark on my soul  not just for his words but how his words and their importance can change to the reader throughout their life   regardless of religion  social preference or upbringing his words have the ability to stir the soul and to channel emotion to a strong degree   once a gift for my late mother in her dying days it remains not a pillar of strength but a pedestal on life   not a road map but a way to look at your surroundings when the path before you seems clouded   it gives you not direction but focuses on finding a clearer path   i ve read several of gibran s other works since then but this stands the test of time   if i could ever call any writing a masterpiece  this would be it  for i still read it and still draw from it every time i pick it up |5.0

a3ujjoyii5rf9j|i ve always been leery of books of this nature and do not follow any organized religon  but something magical happens when you read the prophet  you feel as if gibran s philosophy is an innate part of your being down to the core of your soul  the perfect spirtual elixir that leaves you buzzing with the feeling that this is spot on  if you need something to turn you insideout this is it  seldom have i ever cried reading a book  wonderful |5.0
asnp7rxrzfqaa|i have read and reread the prophet repeatedly since it was given to me circa 1976   the words go together beautifully and express fundamental truths of life in a way that drives the core belief home to me regardless of how i feel when i read them   gibran s statement that  quot    your children are not your children    quot  has helped me many times as my four children  two still in college  were aimed by the archer on the infinite target with a reluctant bow the wisdom of gibran s prophet is practical   the practicality of the prophet lies in the refinements of gibran s words to express the prophet s instructions in as few words as possible   he has done this through careful use of similitude   i think that those persons familiar with the teachings of the bible and jesus will quickly recognize the rightness of the prophet s sayings |5.0

a3v4msigfg6xey|at least 6 out of 5 stars   the deeper that sorrow carves into your being  the more joy you can contain   is my favourite quote from this classic book of magical mystical poetry and philosophy  there is insight and wisdom on every page  25 years after someone first leant me a copy  it seems to have more relevance to life s fundamental challenges than ever kahlil gibran tells the story of almastafa s departure from the city of orphalese  as he leaves  the prophet  almastafa  shares his thoughts on just about every aspect of the human experience   your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding    work is love made visible    and think not that you can direct the course of love  for love  if it finds you worthy  directs your course  however  the prophet  is much more than a few inspiring self help quotes  more a case of some of the deepest eastern wisdom  universally applicable to the human condition  long may it continue to inspire countless numbers of people around the world |5.0
a1iwviobemz5oq|it is a true masterpiece in which almost every  if not every word counts   i have read it over and over again  since a girlfriend gave me a copy just before i left for berkeley to attend law school   i have given copies to many friends  and recommended to others that they buy it and read it carefully there is enormous wisdom in each chapter  especially given the materialistic and secular world in which we live   which often seems for many people to be devoid of meaning or any spiritual underpinnings   gibran cuts through to the beauty and essence of life  and his words are just as profound today as when they were written in the early years of the last century this book should be recommended reading for any young person who is old enough to wonder what life is really all about   indeed  it can be picked up at any age  and it offers insights that are brilliant and beautifully written i urge anyone  who is thinking about buying it  to do so   just peruse a copy at a local bookstore or library  and you are apt to become enthralled   it may take several readings to soak up its essence  and even after many years  i still find nuances and learn more each time i reread it |5.0
af4qky2r2td3u| say not   i have found the truth   but rather   i have found a truth     kahlil gibranas you read  gibran s poetry brings spiritual and visual beauty to life within you   gibran is justly famous for rich metaphors that brilliantly highlight the pursuit of truth and goodness amidst all the darkness and light of human nature this is a book to read alone or with a partner  to give and receive  to go back to again and again note  the excerpts available in amazon s  search this book  facility unfortunately do not do  the prophet  justice  since only the book s introduction is included  whereas the wisdom does not begin unfolding until a bit later   therefore i ve taken the liberty of including here another excerpt which more properly demonstrates the gentle power of gibran s writing    and a woman who held a babe against her bosom said   speak to us of children  and he said your children are not your children they are the sons and daughters of life s longing for itself they come through you but not from you and though they are with you  yet they belong not to you you may give them your love but not your thoughts for they have their own thoughts you may house their bodies but not their souls for their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow  which you cannot visit  not even in your dreams you may strive to be like them  but seek not to make them like you for life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday you are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth the archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite  and he bends you with his might that his arrows may go swift and far let your bending in the archer s hand be for gladness for even as he loves the arrow that flies  so he loves also the bow that is stable |5.0

a25tchf9qjdyhc|a very short book  only 133 pages published in 1926  to be honest i have no idea why i downloaded this  i have a vague memory of listening to a radio programme on the author some time ago  which i found interesting  so it must have been that   gibran is described in wikipedia as   the third best selling poet of all time  behind shakespeare and laozi  the book is written in bible esque so if you are not a fan of that or indeed of religion it may not be a book for you   on the other hand and bearing in mind this was published in 1926 almost every passage can be related to every single one of us and our lives today there are no chapter numbers in this short volume but they are defined by the questions asked of  the prophet  by the assembled town folk as he prepares to leave them  returning to his  home  marriagechildrengivingeating and drinkingworkjoy and sorrowcrime and punishmentfreedomreason and passionpainteachingfriendshipgood and evilprayerpleasurereligiondeathso many of the words written by gibran over 80 years ago  must surely  if you are tempted to purchase this book  resonate with something in your life today and his simple but reasoning outlook will remind you to step back and reflect on how you look at life and maybe think that there is something that you can do to change  for the better  on how you interact with others and with yourself i m not saying that i have had a religious or moral epiphany while reading this book  i personally still have no idea whether i am an atheist  agnostic or just a plane old fence sitter waiting for something different or better to come along  if that is indeed possible   i did write somewhere in regard to the bible  and i suppose in the same tone the koran would be included  that i look upon the former as a good novel and if only more people would read it  them  without the religious zealotry and bigotry surrounding it  them   the world would probably be a far better place for all humankind  but that aint gonna happen   but that should not take away from the fact that there are important life lessons in these works that are as relevant today as they were when they were written  as mr gibran s words  i believe  fall firmly within that description enjoy     editing for kindle  4 out 5reading enjoyment  5 out of 5plot overall rating  5 out of 5chapters page length  133|5.0

a2jfg0j3e30jp7|i plan to buy this book and a few others that i had a long time ago  to write a better review i would need to refresh myself on eastern or middle eastern mysticism persian more specifically sufism and also the background of kahlil gibran what i can say is that these small stories or parables or fables are zen like  thought provoking and instructive  i loved this book when i read it and i wrote one of my  still  best poems while i was in the state of mind this book put me in   i m positive it was just after i turned 16 because i have memories connected to reading it in my room with an open window and hearing a friday night football game in the distance from the high school   and not wanting to go to another football game because i had to free my friend from the outside port a potty after my other friend thought she was being funny and held the door closed when the other girl was going to come out    and naturally my claustrophobic friend started screaming and freaking out  she did the same thing i would do anyone of any age can enjoy this book i just wish i had a copy around so i could refresh my memory and do a more detailed review  of course i m sure i would have read it more than the one time i read it  if i did have the same copy i had when i was a teenager  i always read books i really like more than one time this book and the little prince by saint exupery siddhartha demian and steppenwolf  all by herman hesse  are books i read at the same time period and that i also don t have anymore either because i gave my copy to someone or had bought another copy for myself and also gave that copy away  or they just went the way of all things as things go   in time  and my 16th birthday was quite awhile ago   sigh     16 has also  gone the way of all things     but not completely  anyone who likes the prophet  or any of the other titles i mentioned  can consider themselves lucky if they have a friend who has read or who has one of these books on their bookshelves or who has a friend that would also appreciate this type of literature   it s   a beatles thing   not so much connected to the beatles  but people who like the same type of music always like their friends more when their friends like the same type of music that they like  beatles  zeppelin pink floyd rob zombie  black sabbath or godsmack   or johann sebastian bach   writing or music it s still art  and we just feel more comfortable with people who have interests or feelings or an intellect similar to our own      aesthetic magnetism is a vibration more in tune with the spirit and everyone is in love with their soul mate s    to have common ground  or be in sympathy with one another on a deeper level than the common plane of the inescapable movements of the mundane      anyone reading the prophet and finding themselves on common ground with the author will find gratification and will know exactly what i mean in what i wrote in this short review |5.0

a27xuu2dxilhyz| the prophet  is almustafa  called  the chosen and the beloved   who has lived twelve years in the foreign city of orphalese  and is now waiting for the ship that is to come and take him back to the isle of his birth   just as the ship appears  all the men and women of the community  including the elders of the city and the priests and priestesses  come to say farewell   they ask him to stay  but he refuses   then the local seeress named almitra addresses him as  prophet of god  and asks him to speak to them of love and then marriage   after this  others ask him to speak of various subjects  some lofty such as children  giving  and joy and sorrow  and others more mundane  such as eating and drinking  work  houses  and buying and selling   there are in fact a total of 26 short chapters in which  the prophet  holds forth before he takes his leave   kahlil gibran was born gubran khalil gibran to a maronite catholic family in the historic town of bsharri in modern day lebanon  then part of the ottoman empire  his mother kamila was the daughter of a priest   when his father was imprisoned for embezzlement  kamila decided to follow her brother to the united states  settling in the south end of boston  ma  then the second largest lebanese american community in the united states  due to a mistake at school  he was registered as kahlil as a young man gibran studied art and began a literary career   his first book for the alfred a  knopf publishing company  was the madman in 1918  a slim volume of aphorisms and parables written in a biblical like cadence somewhere between poetry and prose   the prophet is said to be an early example of  inspirational fiction  consisting of a series of philosophical essays written in poetic english prose   the book became especially popular during the 1960s with the american counterculture and new age movements   much of gibran s writings seems based on christianity  but his mysticism reveals a convergence of several other influences as well  including islam  sufism  hinduism  and theosophy   to illustrate the relativistic nature of gibran s theology   the prophet  says   say not   i have found the truth   but rather   i have found a truth     jesus said   you shall know the truth   john 8 32   and   i am the way  the truth  and the life   john 14 6    gibran followed the prophet with the garden of the prophet  which narrates almustafa s discussions with nine disciples following his return after an intervening absence and was published posthumously in 1933   gibran had died in new york city  ny  on april 10  1931  the cause was determined to be cirrhosis of the liver and tuberculosis i would never have gone out and purchased this book myself   however  i have heard of it all my life   it is supposed to be a classic and a  spiritual masterpiece   so when i found it in my father s library after his death  i decided to keep it and read it   my reaction is   ugh    as far as i am concerned  it is mostly pantheistic nonsense   someone might say   it s all greek to me   but since i took two years of greek in college  if it were  all greek  i might be able to make some sense of it   i ll just say it s all gobblety gook to me   the chicago post said that the prophet  brings to one s ears the majestic rhythm of ecclesiastes    ecclesiastes i can understand  the prophet i do not   this doesn t mean that there s nothing good in it   the ravings of a lunatic sometimes contain a kernel of truth   even a broken clock is right twice a day   however  there is nothing of value that might be gained from the prophet which can t be learned a whole lot better by simply reading the bible   besides  ten of the twelve full page drawings by the author are rather immodest and consist solely of nude figures   of course  this is not surprising when you read what  the prophet  says about clothes    your clothes conceal much of your beauty  yet they hide not the unbeautiful   and though you seek in garments the freedom of privacy you may find in them a harness and a chain   would that you could meet the sun and the wind with more of your skin and less of your raiment    oh  by the way  even as simply  poetry  it just doesn t do anything for me   it is not a book that i would recommend to anyone under any circumstances |1.0

a2inddw3xyffv1|khalil gibran s the prophet is a truly awe inspiring work of prosaic poetry   despite being a native born arabic speaker  gibran wrote the prophet in english  ensuring that his powerful words lost nothing in translation the work s 28 short chapters recount the words of a prophet as he leaves his home to depart on a new journey   the words that flow from the prophet s mouth and onto the pages are philosophical and spiritual treatises on all aspects of life   chapters discuss the range of human experiences and include discussions such as  on friendship    on pain  and  on death    what unites the 28 chapters is gibran s thought provoking and probing literary style as gibran s prophet invokes his listeners to live life to the fullest   the book is not overtly religious but every word and sentence is filled with a spiritual clarity the book is eminently quotable with every chapter providing a nugget of truth worthy of repeating   amazingly  gibran packs his masterpiece into less than 100 pages  making it a very quick and easy read   readers will find themselves returning to the prophet again and again to recapture the beauty of gibran s words the prophet  which gibran himself recognized as his greatest masterpiece  is a timeless literary classic   its truth has touched generations of readers and will undoubtedly continue to do so |5.0

a7fjvrlmg5bf9| the moon of gomrath  is the wild magical sequel to  the weirdstone of brisingamen   set in alderley edge in cheshire of the present day but harking back to the days of middlearth  both these stories have a very tolkienish way about them  it is an interesting exercise to compare and contrast the characters as they are introduced  it is a pity that garner s books  faring less well than  the hobbit   dropped off the literary radar in the 1980 s  but with the benefit of potter power they are now back in style with new artwork on the cover garner s special art is to take a basic swords and sorcery story and elevate it into a poetry and powers myth with gritty heroes and terrifying villains who hard to defeat and not always easy to spot  this story of colin and susan s second adventure is aimed at a slightly older audience than the weirdstone  has susan in the lead role  and has more depth and menace along with some sly humour  the morrigan is back  not yet at the height of her powers  but ready for revenge  the elves are suffering and dying from the pollution caused by man  they must retreat to cleaner  remoter places  the battles in magic and swordplay are more deadly and more personal and more realistic  the havoc and hard pace of war are felt in the prose  which is breathless and a little wild itself  the wizard cadellin takes more of a back seat in this adventure but he does explain  in chapter four  why the coming of the  age of reason  and industrialism was more of a coming of the age of materialism and a retreat from reason  hence the great rift between our man s world of material values  and the worlds of magic and the life of the spiritual values now as every parent knows  children s books have the power of forming the child s mind   true even in the age of film and video  as books are both more personal and make mind expanding demands on the imagination  films just fill up whatever space is in your head  they do not create it  books are not just good for you  they are more fun   so with magical adventures being very much back in style now is a good time to get the various authors into some sort of order  so  without going back to the ancient greeks  where does alan garner fit in  we can easily go back a century or so  f  anstey  vice versa   george macdonald  princess and curdie stories   and e  nesbit  house of arden  etc   tolkien  hobbit  farmer giles of ham   c s  lewis  narnia  the land of youth   ursula k  leguin  earthsea   and alan garner  and  as rowling s ghost peeves puts it   wee potty potter   brings us up to date so there are two main routes to magic  anstey  macdonald  nesbit  garner  and rowling write a story that exercises magic in this world  and the two things collide with exciting degrees of chaos and depth  the results are serious or hilarious  or both  garner manages to interface the two worlds with superior art  but a higher priced ticket will take you to a whole new world  tolkien  lewis  and leguin create whole worlds of their own and people it with new peoples   a fully magical world  the magic is integrated  truly part of the fabric of that world  not just added to make it fizz  one you are in  you belong there for a while  you return and your own world is now a little more magical  the whole range of literary forms is now possible  even super possible as we no longer rely on supposed  realism  to make the effects  they go beyond just making a magical talisman or two  some brilliantly done  others less so   and seeing  what happens   they make new countries and skies  new kingdoms and peoples  new languages and rules  ultimately they are the suns and the others are the moons |5.0

a1uf72fgy08k6v|after reading the first two i was expecting much of this book and robin jarvis has provided the best of the three  this is one exciting read  neil returns from glastonbury with edie and the late miss veronica webster s body only to find another more chalenging adventure waiting for him  a strange ghost hunter who he met in the previous installment has been invited into the wyrd museum and as soon as he enters the museum begins to come back to life  old spells lying dormant begin to awake to help protect the websters against the approaching evil forces of woden the gallows god  but one of woden s agents has already infultrated the wyrd museum in the form of evil warder jack  tick tock timms  a man bestode with time traveling powers by woden and sent to kill the remaining webster sisters and edie  assisted by his faithfull companion quoth the raven neil must help to protect the websters in this their final stand against the forces of evil this is the biggest and most complex of the three books  it also holds some of the major character developments  ursula webster s constant battle against her approaching insanity  celidine webster already insane but driven further into the black abyss of her mind by the death of her sister veronica  edie makes friends with a strange new character of the gogus a small imp but the gogus  loyalties are unclear  neil has a new relationship with the mysterious ghost hunter who has now entered the museum  quoth also has a dilema  he is offered a choice of staying with his beloved new master neil and being punished by having his power of speach taken away and then finally being killed or returning to his old master woden and becoming the evil memory once more also neil s father brain chapmann plays a much bigger role in the happening of the wyrd museum  confused and afraid by all the strange events occuring he stops looking after himself and begins to loose his temper a lot easier this amazing story boils over and with the museum its self turning against them our heros are loosing hope for the future of the world fast  this is definatly the best of the trilogy with thrills  splills and one fantastic twist near the end |5.0
a39j92ojuyhvnk|the follow up to the raven s knot and the woven path  this is a fast paced  action packed thriller whose pace doesn t let up for a minute  the villains are detestable  the young heroes are flawed but likeable and the other characters are mostly insane  the decaying wyrd museum provides a perfect backdrop for this sad tale of the inevitability of change  that doesn t mean that there isn t a light at the end of every tunnel  and this book does contain a message of hope for the future amid a grim present it isn t quite as moving and beautiful as the raven s knot  but makes up for it by being even scarier and more demanding the characters are well drawn  especially the cruel asylum guard  tick tock jack   the webster sisters  hero neil s very flawed father and best of all  quoth   neil s adorable conflicted talking raven  highly recommended |4.0

a2x0g7qmlzxp08|i had read alistair maclean as a teenager and enjoyed his writing very much  but i had to wait until now at the age of 57 to pick up hms ulysses  how could i have allowed this treasure to elude me for so long   this book starkly portrays the horrors of war at sea where the savage elements  the unbelievable cold and the implacable enemy combine to strip away all hope  but that is only half of the whole  for hms ulysses is full of compassion  human warmth and wonderful characters so beautifully portrayed that it was so easy to identify with them and their trials and imagine that this great ship and her extraordinary crew really existed   such was the power of the writing that i was left with a feeling of loss when i reached the end of the final page  hms ulysses is a beautiful story that you must read and if there were a way of awarding it more than 5 stars  i would gladly do so  don t wait more than 40 years like i did  buy it now and don t loan it to anybody  let them buy their own copy  they ll want to anyway |5.0

a1yf0skmgv2bil|when this item arrived  i was disappointed because they sent me the abridged version and it only had four stories instead of five   but i decided to give it a chance and i found that basil rathbone narrates sherlock holmes as good as he portrayed him on the radio or other recorded media such as  the new adventures of sherlock holmes   which is now on compact disc  with the exception of the final four episodes in the series   but i believe they will get those on cd soon  as to this narration itself  i felt that mr  rathbone set out to speak as john h  watson  m d  in the fashion he was so used to hearing  that of nigel bruce s interpretation of the character   there are times  and i don t know if it is him or the audio cassette  but basil rathbone sounds more like nigel bruce s dr  watson than rathbone s sherlock holmes   i enjoyed the tape trememdously and would even recommend the abridged version to someone who is a fan of sherlock holmes and or basil rathbone so i do give this narration five stars with no hesitation   my only regret is that rathbone didn t narrate more sherlock holmes stories |5.0

a2kalati106d7j|i am an avid reader of historical fiction  with the emphasis on the  historical  rather than the  upthrust breast  variety   this catastrophe fails at both  i have read many many entries in this genre from the extraordinary to the putrid   lady of hay falls somewhere below this last category   as other readers have commented  this book is about 200 pages too long  the author has managed to confuse tedium with suspense by dragging out the conclusion long past the point of reader exhaustion   ms  erskine s attempts to interweave the present day  plot  with historical narrative is a complete failure  as she only manages to disrupt both story lines resulting in a herky jerky narrative flow that became quite annoying   compounding the problem  not a single character is the slightest bit sympathetic  and although i began the read with curiosity and interest  i ended feeling frustrated and cheated   there are many red herrings dropped along the way that kept me reading  but i got no satisfaction at the end   why do we meet everyone s mother   how many literary agents  photographers and editors need to be introduced by their names  only to drop from sight 20 pages later   what about nurse jeanne s foreshadowing of matilda s illegitimate daughter ultimately giving her secret away resulting in calamity   did i miss that scene as i waded through episode after repetitive episode of modern jo swooning in the rain as she  channels  lady matilda   there are too many superfluous characters  seemingly all of whom are interested in and experienced with past life regression  who i kept expecting would have some role in the overall  meaning  of this morass  but they never did   not to mention  most of the players seem good candidates for alcoholics anonymous   i cannot recall another novel which features wine  ale  scotch  pimms and their ilk as the central focus in seemingly every scene   the insane behavior of all principals appeared to be nothing more than the result of years of alcohol poisoning   a medieval lost weekend   i became so exasperated with their antics and cruel misdeeds that i actually found myself rooting for them all to be sent to the pokey or a rehab facility this book was a major disappointment in every way   it is short on history and long on artifice   if there were some way to award negative stars  this is the ideal candidate   save your money |1.0

aovjyiuatqkr5|this is a review for both the hard cover book and the audio casette i read this 10 years ago  as the second book following the zahn trilogy   by comparison it was natural to feel disappointed   but over the years  listening to it several times on audio cassette it has grown on me   the question you are asking  with so many sw books to select from should you read this one   yes luke falls in love   the characters here appear in the corellian trilogy   bakura and biotechnology used by the ssi ruuk is revisited in the ill intentioned njo series   though it didn t seem to fit when i first read the book  the story here does fit nicely with the entire expanded universe on the timeline i have this one at year 4 5 anh   the story takes place right after the battle at endor in rotj   ben appears and tells luke to go to bakura   luke  at age 20 is in command and can only assemble a small force after the devastation of the battle they have just fought   naturally the falcon  han  leia and chewy are available to assist the point of the plot is for the rebels to help the imperial garrison on bakura defend against an invasion that is coming from the unknown regions   the invaders are large reptilian creatures that  when they speak sound like flutes playing   they use entechment to take the essence of sentient beings and place that essence inside their machines to run those machines this is a book i recommend reading if you are now deciding to read the stories written for the classic era which starts with the han solo trilogy and ends with the zahn duology and the dark horse comic union   fortunately  at this writing  amazon com had both new and used audio cassettes and paperbacks for sale audio casette   this is an abridged version that can be listened to in about 2  hours   anthony heald is the reader and he is the best   i recommend all the bantam audio books for star wars   they do a great job presenting the books with music and sound effects |4.0

axc0z4e30m3pi|yes  it s true there is a bit more description of the rights of english landlords in the nineteenth century than i would have liked  there is less actual sailing than in previous books  so this volume doesn t have the sense of motion that o brian portrays so well  yet this remains a fascinating book  true to form  o brian describes life in it s nitty gritty detail  whether it s the horrendous personal violence of bonden s boxing match  or the consequences of jack s infidelity  yet the eloquence of his description and the sympathy for the characters that o brian evokes keeps the reader deeply involved  it s not as much of an adventure story as previous books  yet there is an agreeable sense of community and familiarity when all the characters are staying with one another on land  and of course the ending makes you want to read the next one immediately |4.0

a177renqjimmr9|a reading of this book resembles a leafing through an album of old photographs dedicated to some unknown man named george hardy  each of the three narrators  who were once connected and loved him  though in different  manner and degree   shows two pictures and tells their prehistories  the  image of master georgie as a respectable  decent man turns into a central  figure of such a weird sexual and family conundrum that it will take some  time to perceive  an affectionate son turns into a frigid father and lover   a drunkard into a brave surgeon of the english army during the crimean war   etc  the book ends in horrible bloody scenes of the senseless war carnage   ms beryl bainbridge does not give an opportunity for george hardy to speak   so we close the book but still do not understand who and what was george  and why these three persons were so devoted to him  just as in a real life   people come and go  we think we know them  but we usually know only their  external appearance  and their essence remains a mystery   |4.0
ai4mud97fh6g2|it s difficult to know quite where to begin here  in the face of such overwhelming praise from so many satisfied readers  it s not that it s badly written  just that it fails to illuminate master georgie s life  that after all should be its purpose  particularly where  as here  that person existed and at least one of the events described took place  the author is content to conjure up others to act as prisms  which would be a useful literary device if they illuminated the central figure  but instead we see him through a glass darkly  i may be in a minority of one  but it failed to live up to my expectations |2.0
atwvc3wqozsfs|master georgie is a novel set in the time of the crimean war  through the eyes of three people close to master georgie  myrtle  a girl believed to be georgie s sister  dr  potter  a geologist and pompey jones  the photography assistant  we follow him from liverpool to the battlefield of the crimean war this way to write about a person and his happenings is well known through ian pears an instance of the fingerpost  and can be a perfect way to keep the readers interest and also the readers capability to live with the story  but beryl bainbridge do not master this art in this book  the language is too flat  without feelings  and the plots are sometimes too cryptical to be understood  i had to read several parts more than once to be able to understand what it all really was about  and to understand which lenses where used still the book has some good parts  among them are the battlefield scenes  and i also like the way bainbridge use the meaning of the photography  to let us see snapshots of master georgie s life  using other people as lenses  as cameras the book is a short one  less than 200 pages  and the surprising ending helps to give meaning to the story britt arnhild lindland|3.0

a3viocjz22jzxt|historic fiction requires exceptional skills to capture character as well as time and place  beryl bainbridge s master georgie certainly excels in this regard  reminding me of the skills of hilary mantel  the plight of a crimean war surgeon comes alive in all its gore and misery and insanity  the tale is told through the eyes of the surgeon s brother in law  his off and on boyfriend and photographic assistant  and myrtle  an orphan informally adopted by the family and mother of his children  the crimean war offers a backdrop of incompetent diplomatic and military leadership dissolving into a nightmare of gore  horror  disease  dysentery  crime  and cruelty  bainbridge captures the disorganized international disaster with many horrible bloody details  having her characters do the best they can to survive the catastrophe  yet  bainbridge captures more than just history  time  place  and character for her writing is poetic and her attention to detail is superb  early in the novel  myrtle cleans the dog hair off of a tiger skin rug and as she pulls the white dog hairs from the brush  they float like dandelion seed up the wind draft of the staircase and nestle on the chandelier  it is such details that make the book beautiful and horrible at the same time  the pace of the book is excellent and she moves the reader from critical chapter to chapter in the lives of the main characters  i almost think she wrote too little in this book  i would have loved to have the book twice as long  the character of pompey jones  the bisexual street urchin  is fascinating and i wish bainbridge had written a novel just for this self aware  self assured  character to follow master georgie  bainbridge actually focuses much of the novel on the character of myrtle  and we learn as much about her amazing strength of character as we do about that of her sometime lover george hardy  myrtle and pompey are both orphans  street wise  highly intelligent  and are recognized for their strengths by the hardy family george hardy is never fully explained and made visible to the viewer for his motives are somewhat hidden  as a homosexual or bisexual physician from an upper class home  it appears that his service in the crimean is somewhat of a penance  a sacrifice  for his sexuality  he strives to be the perfect son to his father  mother  and siblings  yet the secret of his sexuality means that a critical part of him must be hidden from his family  george hardy appears to sacrifice himself during the crimean war due to his sexual orientation over which he has no control  in some ways this is also a study of gay guilt in the victorian period and the mechanisms and strategies undertaken to atone for an unacceptable sexual orientation  george is contrasted with pompey who seems much more at home with his bisexuality  recognizing it as more a part of himself and as an asset by which he can manipulate both men and women  the narrative of war is haunting  reminding me of the outstanding novels of pat barker about world war i  we read of handsome shirtless soldiers dying from eating unwashed cherries or horses bleeding to death while standing with bullet holes through their body  it is the third narrator  dr  potter  george s brother in law that offers unique looks at all the other characters  potter is intellectual and foolish at the same time  he lacks practicality but his power of observation is evident  overall the book is excellent  a post modern masterpiece  telling a complex tale from multiple points of view but never giving the  definitive  story behind the story |5.0

ach1lgm2032qv|from the first pages  this novel fails to draw one into its world to the  extent of its most recent predecessors   the 1840s in england do not come  alive quite as well for ms  bainbridge as the early 1900s of her the  birthday boys and every man for himself   this may be a result of the  narrative coming from different observers of the events  which perforce  must take the time to limn each separate narrator as he or she appears   while this method succeeds quite powerfully in the birthday boys  with the  various members of the scott expedition continuing the story from their  differing points of view  it does not work as well here   master georgie  lacks the successive stream of events  as exists in the birthday boys   which could hold together the differing shifts of narrative however  the  story takes on an absorbing sense of urgency as the 1850s arrive and the  characters shift to the crimea   these later episodes certainly contain the  strongest writing in this work   ms  bainbridge s descriptions of war are  chillingly gruesome  even though the focus is usually only upon the fringe  of battle itself  but seem at times to be lazily gloomy   certainly the  atrocities of the crimean or any war merit the most horrid descriptions   but aside from some poignant scenes  much of the horror is conveyed through  somewhat stock descriptions of the filth  disease  deprivations and  insanity that accompany every war   furthermore  neither the action nor the  characters  especially the title character who throughout remains shadowy  and elusive  seem to progress substantially during these latter stages of  the novel all in all  this is still a very fine book  that perhaps  suffers only in comparison to the author s greater works |4.0

a320lixk6peicj|the news of the death of beryl bainbridge last year made me want to read books by a very accomplished writer  in our book club we chose to read master georgie this was a great disappointment  we should have asked for advice on what books to read  the book was nominated for the booker prize in 1998  but did not win the award while there is an interesting historical episode as the background  and there were different viewpoints  the reader never feels that this is a book that must be read  at times it seemed disjointed  there were narratives from different characters  but that style did not feel the gaps  different narratives normally means the reader gets an insight into an event from different perspectives  this did not happen so need to read other books to appreciate the greatness of beryl bainbridge|2.0

a1v3s3y5kappzw|in a revolving first person narrative  three people who are close to george narrate the events of their mid nineteenth century life  these narrations center around photographs taken at certain points  through the course of the novel the idea of an image taken is made increasingly more complex as is the mystery of george who is most often portrayed idealistically as a man of high knowledge and wisdom  through the carefully written language of the narrative  there are surprisingly human incidents and facts revealed that are startlingly human  these are placed in the frame of the historical context leading to the war between england and russia  the gruesome events of the war that follow strip each of the three characters of their pretence and leaves them yearning for the image of their lost ideal  master george  this is a fascinating experiment in looking at ways of perception  the identities they fashion for people and the personal impact of assumptions about other people s identities |4.0

aiwfnxby3b7tm|i was attracted to this mesmerizing novel by its meditations on 19th century photography  victorian middle class hypocrisy and the crimean war  photography binds this brief novel together and bainbridge revels in its  historical and metaphorical possibilities  she organizes her chapters  around photographs  which makes the reader immediately aware that she he is  to infer meaning from this practice and speculate on the role of  photography in determing what and how we see and remember  bainbridge is  very sensitive to and aware of 19th century photography  its use during the  crimean war  the first war that photographs were taken of   connection to  both science and magic  and the practice of post mortem photography  the  reader does have to work to explore the themes suggested by the author  but  her historical grounding  lucid prose and rich subject make the effort  worthwhile |4.0

a1z1ynklzhncj1|at first  i was going to tick beryl bainbridge off for writing too well  too literary   i thought it nonsense that an illiterate girl in nineteenth century liverpool could never write such exquisite prose as evidenced in  this novel  and that this was a case of the authorial voice being too  strong   as it happened  i couldn t have been more wrong   this novel is  narrated by the close acquaintances of  master georgie   although some are  closer than others   starting with the illiterate myrtle   immediately we  are drawn into the action  as this sequence of a photograph being taken  will resound throughout the novel    master georgie  is incredibly subtle   and it is only by looking back over it that you begin to appreciate that  this is the most suitable of beginnings   here is where myrtle begins on  her road to becoming a lady   and what an unsavory road it is  as myrtle s  help is initially required to cover up the manner in which george hardy s  father has died  and leads to the bloody battlefields of the crimea   also  assisting with the cover up is the duck boy and street urchin  pompey jones  and the pompous dr  potter  whose narrations are by far the best   george  hardy himself is an ambiguous figure  seen only through the eyes of others   it may be a fault that we never really get to know him   this is a novel  of cameras  carnality  and carnage   the dreadful shadow of history is cast  upon it  with the famous charge of the light brigade lightly alluded to   one almost expects to run into a lady with a lamp at every corner  but  fortunately  bainbridge avoids this excess   she takes events frozen in  time  such as the front cover s photograph  and brings them into life and  death  and maybe even beyond   the camera never lies    or does it   bainbridge fervently burrows into the psyche of characters  enabling them  to bring about apparitions vivid enough to be captured by film   in my  mind s eye  i see bainbridge pouring over ancient photographs from the  crimea  trying to put names to faces and to see if she could walk around in  their bloody shoes   she succeeds   if i d have been on 1998 s booker  panel  i know i would have placed bainbridge before mcewan   and the reason  wouldn t have the desire to give her a consolatory  but demeaning  long  service award   in this instance   master georgie  speaks for itself |4.0
a2z28x7vm4fxnp|perhaps i read without sufficient attention   i didn t initially realise that the narrator was changing persona in different chapters  there were subtle references to homosexuality mixed in with the war theme  so subtle that i had to re read this short novel to sort everything out  however  i think beryl bainbridge has a masterly technique  and the ending really underlined the poignant irony of the whole story and its themes   a very highly regarded writer  i shall read more of her novels  this was a good  provoking start |4.0
a12ri2clugcz26|at first glance master georgie by beryl bainbridge suggests it might be quite a light book  an easy read  a period piece set in the mid nineteenth century  this would be wrong  master georgie is no safe tale of country house manners  of marriages imagined by confined  embroidering young women  beryl bainbridge s master georgie is anything but a tale of such saccharine gentility master georgie is a surgeon and photographer  and the book is cast in six plates   photographic plates  not chapters  death figures throughout  from start to finish morbidity crashes into the lives of the book s characters  we begin with mr moody  dead in a brothel bed  his host of minutes before in shock  later we move to the crimean war  where the carnage is graphic  extensive and apparently random  and even then individuals find their own personal ways of adding insult and injury to the suffering the book uses multiple points of view  we see things master georgie s way  myrtle  an orphan he takes in  adds her perspective  the fussy geologist  dr potter  imprints his own version of reality  and still there are less than explained undercurrents  undeclared motives which affect them all  thus  overall  master georgie is a complex and ambitious novel  though it is set in a major war  the backdrop is never allowed to dominate  the characters experience the consequences of conflict and register their reactions  but we are never led by the nose trough the history or the geography of the setting but we also never really get to know these people  myrtle  perhaps  has the strongest presence  she has a slightly jaundiced  certainly pragmatic approach to life  but even she finds the privations of wartime tough  why the characters of master georgie are all so keen to offer themselves as support for the war effort is an aspect of the book that never fully revealed itself  and ultimately this was my criticism of beryl bainbridge s book  while the overall experience was both rewarding and not a little shocking  i found there was insufficient delineation between the characters and their differing motives  the beauty of the prose  however  more than made up for any shortcoming  the language created the mixed world of mid nineteenth century politeness and juxtaposed this with the visceral vulgarities of soldiering and the general struggle of life  this rendered master georgie a complex  moving and quite beautiful book |4.0
ajodimjx61856|it is amazing how some writers can blather on for hundreds of pages and yet be barren of memorable phrase or image  yet how a select few demonstrate the maxim of  quot less is more  quot   beryl bainbridge and  her most recent novel master georgie surely fall into this latter category   each chapter in this short  190 pages  novel takes its title from a  picture illustrating its contents   this is an effective technique  as the  photographic image provides both a jumping off point for bainbridge s  particular scene and narrator  the novel is given from several points of  view  and a framing device for the scene  i look forward to more of her  fiction |4.0
a194jom5wozawa|the writing is first rate  deft  spare  elegant and it is quite good enough to pull you through the book   it is a short book  after all   i would fault ms  bainbridge  though  for the confusing similarity of the  narrative voice for the three narrators   it makes the book unnecessarily  hard to follow my biggest problem is with the title character  george  hardy  he is by turns arrogant  cold as a fish  pissy  condescending   bloodlessly asexual   the narrators  devotion to him is hard to fathom and  one s lack of identification with him renders the book uninvolving another problem  this is not a book to read if you are looking to find  out something about the crimean war  as i was   the book is very elliptical  as regards its historical subject and i found this frustrating   if you are  planning to read the book and are not familiar with the facts and  background of the crimean conflict i would suggest some preliminary  research |3.0
a1b9vx6mz0mz1t|the back cover of this book praises beryl bainbridge for her  quot deadpan prose quot  and her  quot emotionless sentences quot   it s ironic how attibutes like these can possibly be descriptions of a good writer  it is these very faults that bring about the ruin of master georgie the novel spans the years 1846 1854  master georgie  or george hardy   is the young son of a rich liverpool merchant  he is a shadow figure in the sense that he never takes over the narration of the story  that is left up to three other characters  one of these is myrtle  an orphan who was taken in by the hardys as a child and is deeply in love with george  she follows him in his restless wanderings of liverpool  one night  in a sordid episode they find george s father dead in the bed of a prostitute  along with another character who does narration  pompey jones  a street hustler   they are able to cover up the scandal that would have hurt and tarnished his family  the three characters are bonded by this secret for the rest of their lives  and as the novel progresses this deepens into love  both sexual and spiritually  it becomes a love triangle which causes a lot of pain and little satisfaction  the last voice that enters into the picture is  the eccentric dr  potter who has a hankering for george s sister  nobody likes the guy because instead of confronting life  he dwells instead in books  mainly the classical writers of rome and greece  when you start a conversation with him  he begins quoting from an author instead of communicating sense to you  towards the latter part of the book  all the characters become involved in the crimean war  or actually george becomes involved in the war and wherever he is it sucks the others with him  just like all wars  this one changes the future of not just the combatants but also of the bystanders the parts of the book set in liverpool are quite good and interesting  they seem to be written with more passion and personal knowledge than the war scenes  the books problem lies in the deadpan writing  it s like watching the stand up comedy of steven wright  where a monotone voice is supposed to make you laugh by its very absence of emotion  it s the same thing here  we are supposed to feel horror and love through understatement when neither of these emotions are capable of understatement  the closer i got to the end  the more bored i got  i skipped over some pages to get to the end  i didn t care about the character s fates  i just wanted to say i finished it |2.0
a37f1g84k35fcz|ms  beryl bainbridge writes historical fiction with as much skill as any writer  and much better than others who attempt the genre  her stories rarely have definitive separations between what actually happened  and what might have happened to the characters she creates  the crimean war is the setting this time  and while historically noteworthy is not as familiar as some of her other subjects  like the titanic  or the doomed scott expedition to the south pole  what is consistent is her ability to jump about through time periods without ever losing credibility  each of her books reads as if a unique pen is behind each one  the hand of course is the same  however the moods created are remarkably singular the character that is the book s title is a complex human study  or if you prefer  a very intricate person but occupied with a mind and personality as muddled  as it is diverse  a grotesque death scene is the entrance for one of the narrator s of the book  an individual that would have lived as a street urchin but for chance  and an ambiguous bit of goodwill  a second street personality with many more wiles and flexible conduct also becomes a member of master georgie s entourage  this second narrator has a unique view of events  as he is close when master georgie requires  for the latter s sexuality is repressed at best  these are just two people who eventually head to the middle of the crimean war  and the question that keeps shadowing the reader is why escape from the latter half of 19th century london is an easy answer for george  but what of the others  taking a trip toward an impending war as george s groupies is one matter  staying in the midst of a war is much more puzzling  this is one of the most difficult of ms  bainbridge s books that i have read  previous works have often served as a metaphor for the time they occupy  or the closing act in a world that is about to undergo great disruptive change  this work is not as apparently decisive one characteristic is consistent  and that is her master s grasp of language  a lapful of cherries that serve as a metaphor will haunt a reader for some time  her images of the dead and dying are less grotesquely graphic than most writers portray  but are far more disturbing than other wartime battles  this may not be the best of her work if it is the first of hers you experience  however if you can successfully decipher this one  that are several others that are much more comfortable to read |4.0
a1mjmylrtz76zx|be aware that this audio tape is an abridged version of the book  so it s missing some material  the most important parts are here  though  and if you re a fan of audio books and tapes  which a lot of people like to listen to while they re commuting or travelling in their cars  this one is fine if you don t mind the fact that it s not the entire book  the only reason i give it four stars instead of five is that it is an abridged version i had a few other comments about the story  i don t read much fiction these days  sticking mostly to history and nonfiction  but i made an exception for this novel since i am a student and teacher of a couple of japanese martial arts  and i d absorbed some small knowledge about things like geishas during my studies  and i d heard about how good the novel was i wasn t disappointed  i found golden s book about a geisha during the 1930s  when the geisha tradition and culture was already dying  to be an accurate  detailed  and well written story about the life of what could have been a typical geisha  for me it s reminiscent of yasunari kawabata s famous novel  snow country  a bittersweet story about a love affair between a wealthy tokyo playboy and a provincial geisha in a remote mountain town  kawabata won the nobel prize in literature in 1968  the bittersweet quality derives from the fact that the geisha knows that although by most standards she is still young  she is past her prime and is one of the last of a dying breed like kawabata s novel  golden s novel sensitively and realistically portrays the world of the geisha during a time when it was already waning  golden shows that  contrary to western stereotypes of geishas as ordinary prostitutes  they were highly cultured and educated  trained in music  poetry and the arts  and more than able to hold their own and intelligently converse on many subjects with their often wealthy and powerful clients i understand this is golden s first book  it s a fine debut by a new author and i hope it won t be his last  it will be interesting to see what he does next after such a spectacular debut by the way  an interesting little side note here  i ve studied a little japanese  and japanese is replete with epithets  slang  and various and sundry derogatory words relating to people s mental  moral  and physical shortcomings  one funny aspect of this is how reptiles and especially turtles come in for a lot of abuse  calling someone a turtle  for example  means you re saying they re slow or unintelligent  and if you call someone a  deb game   it translates literally as  a turtle with buckteeth   but the actual meaning is a  peeping tom  |4.0

a1af30h2mpoo9|the narrative is an excellent one  but the name of the story is a  give away   it could have been named something else only to make it harder  for the reader to guess the outcome one associates archer s shortstories  with unexpected endings and this story is a dissapointment in that respect   having said that  otherwise the story is engaging and the style of  narration interesting |4.0
a3qivq3sket6tw| the grass is always greener  is a short story from archer s latest offering   to cut a long story short   surprisingly not listed here at amazon    not twenty pages long  it portrays the relationships between  people at critchley s bank  starting with homeless bill  who sleeps outside  the building   kevin  the doorman is next the story progresses up the  chain of employees  culminating in sir william  the bank s chairman   each  character is shown to be jealous of the person ahead of them in the pecking  order  but as we move further up the ladder  those characters provoking  such jealousy have such great problems that no one would want their  position it is an interesting tale in what is otherwise archer s most  lacklustre offering of short stories to date |4.0

a2t5rbn49fvxzx|it isn t obvious from anything on this page  but this is a cassette   not the end of the world  but kind of low fi   i m sure i ll get around to converting it someday  but it would be nicer to not have to of course  the main thing is the comedy which is pretty solid   ardal mainly does observational humor with a bit of an absurd twist   unfortunately  he tends to be a visual comedian   i mean  i can laugh just to look at him   so you miss out on his facial expressions  but there are few bits that are solely visual gags   you hear uproarious laughter from the audience  but they don t work with only the aural experience also  a number of the bits are topical and therefore kind of dated  michael flatley jokes   that isn t so much of a complaint  but more of an observation  because ultimately they are funny  but it doesn t have that  timeless  feel to it so  if you are an ardal nut and don t mind time warp technology  go right ahead  but others beware the limitations |4.0

a142efchx4zj31|unfortunately this book is out of print  but it is by far the best book which helped get my son interested   the drawings are delightful and full of expression   for example   and i m paraphrasing   the pawns are foot soldiers  marching up one by one  and can stubbornly block others from advancing  in short  the analogy to soldiers in war is what my son likes so much about the book   he gets to attack me and strategize about it   he is given freedom among a few rules  you can move whereever you want but only diagonally  in the case of the bishop    i was amazed at how fast he was strategizing several moves ahead   the final pages are full of advanced terms and all are explained well  with pictures to help explain the moves and practice  games  i wish the uk would reprint this book  in hardcover   the paperback we got  only thing left  will not last long |5.0

a53zwhwglpzqv|in 1961  the 24yo vanessa redgrave first played rosalind  by far the best role in  as you like it   by 1963  the 26yo ms  redgrave recreated the finest performance of shakespeare s rosalind for television   try real diligently to find that masterpiece of a film   instead of being afforded the privilege of viewing vanessa redgrave s performance of rosalind become the most acclaimed of all time  thus far  what we do have is this audio recording  while it cannot possibly be compared to watching the matriarch of the redgrave clan of british performance artists  50 years ago  perhaps if we use our imaginations pretending to see what she might have done with this role  as she speaks through this audio book  it will suffice  since vanessa redgrave s rosalind has long been considered the world s best ever  having the audio tape portion is much better than nothing at all   the mystery remains  however  why on earth bbc  pbs  and the royal shakespeare company will not share this momentous performance with the world of viewers who d dearly love to own it |5.0
